The enigmatic clitic continues to intrigue linguists because it eludes precise cate- gorization. Questions about its status are difficult to resolve. Is it a lexical item, or an affix? Is it a part of syntax, morphology, or phonology? In her analysis of this linguistic entity, Monachesi (henceforth M.) provides the reader with a thorough overview of current theories of the clitic, although she ultimately believes that a lex- ical approach is the best way to address this construct. Anyone who has attempted to categorize studies about clitics often finds it difficult to situate them in any of the traditional divisions of syntax, morphology, or phonology. This has lead to the cre- ation of blended neologisms such as morphophonology and morphosyntax as a means of classifying these particles. The perplexing essence of the clitic is that it is situated at the locus where the modules of syntax, morphology and phonology con- verge. Clitics share certain characteristics of each of them; yet they resist easy clas- sification in any one. In his discussion of affixes and clitics nearly two decades ago, Carstairs (198 I : 3) elected to use the neutral term ‚appendage™ to refer to these grammatical forms. Lit- tle did he suspect that their status would continue to be the source of theoretical debate at the end of the twentieth century. Carstairs (1981: 4), whose characteriza- tion of appendages, remains valid today, described these linguistic constructs in (1). (1) a. Appendages are BOUND forms (that is, they cannot occur as independent sentences). b. There are tight restrictions on the position of appendages relative to either (a) (roots or stems belonging to) particular parts of speech or (b) adjacent con- stituents of surface structure. c. They are more or less phonetically parasitic, tending to combine with neigh- bouring phonologically-defined ‚words™ in matters such as stress placement and vowel harmony. 0378-2166/~/$ - see front matter 0 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Their shape is often affected by grammatical features (e.g., number, gender, conjugation-type or declension-type) of the item which governs their position (in the sense of [lb] above). If we call this item the ANCHOR of the appendage, we can summarise this characteristic by saying that appendages are often sensitive to their anchors. They are often members of a relatively closed system, one of whose mem- bers must always appear at the relevant place in structure. Published as a revision of the author™s (Monachesi, 1996a) doctoral dissertation at Tilburg University, M. has already established an impressive corpus of research in the area of Italian cliticization (1993a,b,c,d, 1994, 1995, 1996a,b, 1998b) as well as a study on Romanian (1998a). M. states that: ﬁThe ideas developed here are substantially those found in [my] dissertation [Monachesi, 1996a], but the formal aspects of the analysis presented have been refined and improved. I have also provided a more detailed introduction to the framework adopted which should guide the less familiar reader through the formal features of the analysis. Substantial changes can be found in chapter 3 which presents a mor- phophonological analysis of Italian clitics, which was lacking in the dissertation. This treatment has led to some minor revisions to the account of reflexive si discussed in chapter 4. 1 hope to have achieved a more comprehensive analysis which takes the phonological, morphological and syntactic aspects of Ital- ian cliticization into equal consideration.ﬂ (p. xi) In her introductory statement (‚Introduction™: l-20), M. notes that ﬁThis study investigates the status of Italian clitics from the perspective of a lexical& theory such as Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar ([henceforth] HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1987) (Pollard and Sag 1994). The phonological, morphological and syntactic properties of Italian clitics are considered; given their characteristics, clitics represent a topic of central importance for the understanding of the interac- tion of different modules of the grammar.ﬂ (p. I) In the initial chapter, M. poses the fundamental question ‚what are clitics?™ Cli- tics have been the subject of previous research (Carstairs, 1981; Kayne, 1975; Kla- vans, 198.5; Miller, 1992; Zwicky, 1977, 1985; Zwicky and Pullum, 1983). Several special properties of clitics are distinctive. They occur in a special position in the sentence as seen in (2) i.e., ﬁthe accusative clitic lo occurs on the left side of the finite verb, while usually direct objects occur on the rightﬂ (p. 2). (2) Martina lo legge. ‚Martina cl. (act.) reads™ (p. 2) Likewise, clitics must occur in a fixed order as seen in (3) (3) a. Martina me lo sped&e. ‚Martina cl. (dat.) cl. (act.) sends™ b. ﬁMartina lo mi sped&e. ‚Martina cl (act.) cl. (dat.) sends™ (p. 2) The sentences in (2) show that Italian clitics have to appear in a certain order, i.e., ﬁthe direct object usually precedes the indirect object if they are both represented by full phrases. while the examples [in (3)] show that this is not the case if clitics are presentﬂ (p. 2). A third property of clitics in Italian is that they are unstressed as seen in (4). (4) a. Martina lo vuole. ‚Martina cl. (act.) wants™ b. *~arii~~ LO vuale. ‚Martina cl. (ace.) wants™ (p. 2) M. also points out that ﬁIn Italian, there is the third person plural dative clitic lore ‚to them™ which, like other clitics, occurs in a special position within the sentence and it appears adjacent to the verb. However, certain adverbs can separate it from its host and it is stressedﬂ (p. 2). At least one southern Italian dialect, Napoletano, has clitics in which a combination of two receives stress (see pp. 46-52). M. points out that ﬁa crucial question is whether it is possible to reach a coherent and unified con- cept of clitics, thus a clear definition of what clitics are, or if there is no unified cat- egory cliticsﬂ (p. 3). M. also points out yet another issue is the status of clitics, i.e., ﬁthe question of whether they should be treated as affixes or as independent syntactic forms. This is because clitics have a status which is neither obviously that of an independent word, nor that of an affixﬂ (p. 3). Previous research in generative grammar has treated cli- tics variously. Kayne (197_5), for example, assumes that clitics are syntactically independent. A few years later, Zwicky (1977) examines these forms more closely in terms of their phonological, morphological and syntactic properties. Zwicky (1977) classifies these forms into two broad categories: (1) simple clitics ﬁwhich are syntactically normal elements that are phonologically dependent on an adjacent wordﬂ (p, 3); and (2) spe- cial clitics ﬁwhich are elements whose placement cannot be accounted for the nor- mal processes of syntax and for which special rules must be stipulatedﬂ (p. 3). Klavans (1985) subsequently hypothesizes a tripartite typology based on three parameters, namely, dominance, precedence, and phonological liaison. According to M.: ﬁThe first parameter, which has kzirbui or final as values, determines whether the clitic adjoins to the final or initial constituent of a given phrase which is defined as the domain of cliticization. The second one, with values of before or uffer specifies where the clitic attaches in relation to the relevant host, while the last parameter states the direction of phonological attachment of the clitic. In her proposal, Klavans claims that cliticization is actually phrasal affixation, but in this way, Romance clitics constitute an exception since they attach to a head, i.e., the verb. Her conclusion is that Romance clitics represent verbal features and they are becoming affixes since they have insertion requirements which resemble those of other verbal affixes.ﬂ (pp. 34) Chapter 2 (‚The status of Italian clitics™, pp. 21-53) addresses the linguistic cate- gorization of these problematic forms. In fact, M. describes their situation as ‚still open for discussion™ (p. 21). By this statement she means that: 630 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 627-636 ﬁNo definite answer has been provided in the literature to the question of whether clitics should be treated as affixes or as independent syntactic forms. Within the generative tradition it is often assumed that they are syntactically independent elements, hence words, which are located in a special position by the rules of syntax. I will question this assumption and show that Italian clitics on a par with French cli- tics (Miller 1992) and Romanian (Monachesi 1998a), are best treated as afJixa1 elements which combine with the host as a result of morphophonological processes.ﬂ (p, 21). In citing Zwicky (1977), Zwicky and Pullum (1983), Zwicky (1985), M. offers support for the affixal status of clitics. She also cites Joseph (1990) who has pro- vided a list of criteria for the determination of the affixal status of clitics in (5): (5) a. Selectivity in combination. Affix: high selectivity; nonaffix: low selectivity. b. Idiosyncratic behavior. Affix: shows idiosyncrasies; nonaffix: shows few or none. c. Parallel morphological process. Affix: such parallels exist; nonaffix: none. d Ordering. Nonword: strictly ordered; word: some degree of free ordering. e. Phonological dependence. Nonword: dependent; word: independent. (pp. 21-22) M. provides detailed evidence with examples to buttress her claim that Italian cli- tics function as affixes from a morphosyntactic perspective (pp. 22-31): (1) selec- tivity of host (verbs); (2) rigid ordering; (3) coordinate structures; (4) arbitrary gaps, e.g., no combination of first and second accusative clitic with a dative; (5) morpho- logical idiosyncrasies (use of ci for vi in certain instances; alternation of i and e in certain environments); and (6) verb left detachment. According to M., Italian clitics also share certain phonological properties of affixes. Previous researchers in this area (Nespor and Vogel, 1986; Scalise, 1986), however, deny that Italian clitics behave as affixes. Their evidence for this claim is based on specific phonological rules such as Intervocalic s-Voicing (s-voicing does not occur after a prefix, in a compound, before an enclitic, after a proclitic, and in a phrase), Raddoppiamento Sintattico (lengthening of an initial consonant of the sec- ond word of two under certain circumstances), stress assignment, and Troncamento (deletion of a word-final mid vowel ([e] or [o]) after a sonorant consonant before vowels that begin with a consonant; see Nespor, 1994) which treat clitics differently from affixes. Because Italian clitics behave differently phonologically, they must have lexical status. In order to differentiate clitics from affixes, Nespor and Vogel (1986) accord Italian clitics the special constituent status of ‚clitic group™. Finally, M. reviews critically the phonological evidence (Nespor and Vogel, 1986; Nespor, 1994; Scalise, 1986) for the lexical status of clitics, but she rejects it. Instead, M. argues that Italian clitics form a prosodic word on the basis of new data from Nupoletano which are better explained without reference to a special con- stituent such as ‚clitic group™ in the prosodic structure. Perhaps the most important argument for her position derives from the claim that a special constituent (‚clitic Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 627-636 631 group™) is an unnecessary complication of the grammar (Booij, 1996; Peperkamp, 1997). In chapter 3 (‚The analysis of Italian clitics™, pp. 5%89), M. proposes an analysis of Italian clitics within a framework of HPSG as discussed in Pollard and Sag (1987, 1994). This chapter is the theoretical core of the book. In particular, the author states that: ﬁIn the present analysis, clitics will not be considered lexical items, signs, which are located in a specific position by rules of syntax, but featural information which is provided in the lexicon and employed in the morphophonology for realization of the cliticized verb form. Thus, I will assume a realizational approach to morphology (Matthews 1972). (Anderson 1992). (Stump 1992) in which morphemes simply represent the phonological spell out of certain morphosyntactic properties of the verb. However, clitics also exhibit certain characteristics typical of independent words, since they must fulfill the subcatego- rization requirements of the verb of which they are a semantic component.ﬂ (pp. 55-56) With regard to her specific analysis, M. further states that: ﬁA satisfactory analysis of cliticization must thus account both for the syntactic/semantic and the mor- phophonological properties of clitics. The syntactic/semantic contribution of Italian clitics is reflected in the fact that they satisfy the subcategorization requirements of the verb they are an argument of. At the same time it is necessary to provide the featural information necessary for the spell out of the cliticized verb form.ﬂ (p. 56) In order to account for the specific syntactic/semantic properties of Italian cliti- cization, M. proposes the Complement Cliticization Lexical Rule (CCLR, p. 56) which she says: ﬁ establishes a relation between the non cliticized and cliticized verbal forms. In particular, it relates verbs which subcategorize for certain complements with other ones which share the same properties except for the fact that [they] have some complements realized as clitics. Therefore, the effect of the rule is that complements are removed from the COMPS list of the verb and added as members of the CLTS [clitics] list. This feature acts as interface to morphophonology since it contains information which is rel- evant for the realization of the cliticized verb form . . ﬂ (pp. 56-57) In a footnote (p. 56, note 2), M. calls to the reader™s attention that the CCLR is similar to one proposed for French clitics in two unpublished papers by Miller and Sag (1993, 1995) and adapted by the author (Monachesi, 1993b,c). In the same foot- note, the author points out that, in a more recent and published version of their ear- lier papers (Miller and Sag, 1993, 1995), Miller and Sag (1997) abandon, in part, the use of lexical rules in favor of an explanation based on constraints on types. Never- theless, M. reasserts her belief in lexical rules and refers to the reader to section 3.3 (pp. 81-84) of this chapter for further discussion of this matter. Next, M. reviews previous accounts of clitics in various theoretical frameworks. First, she examines syntactic analyses of their distribution (Perlmutter, 1971; Wan- ner, 1977; Seuren, 1976; Emonds, 1975). Next, M. reviews morphological approaches (Bonet, 1991; Simpson and Withgott, 1986; Inkelas, 1993). Third, M. reviews morphophonological explanations of Italian clitics. On the one hand, Krieger and Nerbonne (1992) and Krieger (1994) employ a word-syntax morpholog- 632 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 627-636 ical approach (Selkirk, 1982) in which ﬁ[mlorphemes have the status of signs and they combine with the stem by means of morphological principles which are similar to those that operate in syntax. An X-bar model is often assumed: a complex word will have a head, which has the same category as the motherﬂ (p. 69). Yet another research strategy, and the one followed by M., incorporates realiza- tional approaches (Matthews, 1972; Anderson, 1992; Stump, 1992) to morphology within HPSG. According to M., this strategy does not recognize morphemes as signs. Rather, ﬁ[tlhey simply represent the phonological realization of certain mor- phosyntactic properties of the host they combine withﬂ (p. 70). Spencer (1991) pro- vides a comprehensive discussion of word-syntax and realizational approaches to morphology, other studies in this same vein include Riehemann (1993), Kim (1994), Malouf (1994), Miller and Sag (1997) and others. M.‚s approach to Italian clitics is that: ﬁ verbs which have undergone the lexical operation of cliticization are enriched with the relevant fea- tural information. Appropriate constraints can be proposed to relate the information encoded in CLTS [clitics] to the actual phonological realization of the clitic. Clitics are thus the spell out of certain mor- phosyntactic features of the verb.ﬂ (p. 70) Using Bird and Klein™s (1994) research, M. proposes that the type ‚word™ has an additional attribute, namely, MORPH[eme]. Moreover, MORPH has two sub-types, i.e., complex-morph and basic-morph (p. 70). Furthermore, complex-morph may have the attribute AFFIX (pp. 70-71). Likewise, morph may have the attribute STEM which is inherited by both of its sub-types (p. 71). Finally, STEM has ste- morword as its value (p. 71). In the remainder of this chapter, M. provides an exemplification of her analysis. Moreover, she compares her analysis of cliticization with other HPSG accounts, e.g., Miller and Sag (1997). Her approach is similar to Miller and Sag™s (1997) account because it treats clitics as lexically-attached inflectional affixes, and the mor- phophonological aspect of cliticization forms a part of the analysis. In other ways, M.‚s hypothesis differs from that of Miller and Sag (1997) e.g., she proposes a lex- ical rule rather than a constraint on types. The author also compares her analysis to optimality theoretical accounts of unex- pected clitic sequences (Grimshaw, 1997; Anderson, 1996), and she finds them flawed. Grimshaw™s (1997) analysis is not comprehensive in its treatment of clitic combinations. Likewise, Anderson™s (1996) account of the position of clitics requires additional constraints and is, thus, more complex. M. concludes this theo- retical chapter by observing that her analysis assumes that clitics behave as inflec- tional affixes, and that they do not constitute signs. Chapter 4 (‚The clitic si™, pp. 91-117) addresses the Italian clitic si, whose syn- tactic behavior differs from that of the other object clitics in certain important respects. For one thing, Italian si has multiple meanings: (1) an impersonal interpre- tation: (2) a middle interpretation; (3) an ergative meaning; (4) a reciprocal/reflex- ive interpretation; and (5), and an inherent reflexive clitic. To account for these mul- tiple significations, M. employs an analysis based on research she carried out previously (Monachesi, 1993d) based on Cinque (1988). According to M.: Book review I Linguu 110 (2000~627-636 633 ﬁIn the reflexive reciprocal and in the impersonal interpretation, the clitic si acts as an argument. It fills the relevant slot in the subcategorization requirements of the verb and it contributes to the semantics with agreement information. In the middle, ergative and inherent-reflexive interpretation, clitic si is instead a grammatical marker of the relevant verb form.ﬂ (p. 91). M. then examines the origin of the Italian si construction and its current multi- faceted syntactic and semantic manifestations, and previous research on this form (Cinque, 1988; Castelfranchi and Parisi, 1976; Manzini, 1986). The fifth chapter (‚The clitic h-o™, pp. 119-133) examines yet another problem- atic Italian clitic, namely, h-o. This little studied bisyllabic clitic form (see Cardi- naletti, 1991) is a puzzling grammatical item for linguists and their theories because of its a-paradigmatic grammatical behavior. M. points out its intriguing properties: ﬁThe dative pronoun loro is considered a clitic with an unusual distribution by Calabrese (1988). Cardi- naletti (1991) also points out the intriguing properties of lore, which exhibits a behavior similar to that of the other Italian clitics. Since it occurs in a different position from that of the related complement, it cannot be coordinated and it cannot be modified, but on the other hand it differs from them in several respects, showing the properties of lexical words.ﬂ (p. 119) M. argues that the distinctive grammatical characteristics of the Italian pronoun loro are not an impediment to her analysis. The author ultimately proposes that monosyllabic clitics are affixes while bisyllabic clitics such as loro are signs, or words (p. 120). Among the specific differences of loro and the other Italian clitics are the following: (1) sentence position (pp. 121-123); (2) ordering relative to the other Italian clitics (p. 124); (3) coordinate structures (p. 124); (4) clitic climbing (pp. 125-127); and (5) word stress (pp. 127-128; see Nespor, 1994). Chapter 6 (‚The analysis of Italian restructuring verbs™, pp. 135201) the final chapter of this volume, deals with the phenomenon of clitic climbing, i.e., the move- ment of clitic pronouns from a position in a subordinate clause to a superordinate one. This chapter is a revised version of the author™s previous study on Italian restructuring verbs in a lexical framework (Monachesi, 1998~). M. notes that Sportiche (1996) has argued that ﬁclitic climbing is incompatible with a lexical analysis of cliticization because in this construction the clitic bears no lexical relation relationship to the main verb it is attached to, but it is lexically related to the embedded verb insteadﬂ (p. 135). Her resolution to this not insignifi- cant issue is to argue for a ‚nonlocal dependency™ (p. 135). While M. focuses her attention on those verbs that trigger restructuring (Rizzi, 1982), she also examines cases of nonlocal dependencies in other structures (NP-movement, tough construc- tions, and auxiliary selection). The essence of her analysis is based on ‚argument composition™, the process by which subcategorization requirements of the subordi- nate predicate are moved upwards to the clitic-climbing trigger verb (p. 135; see, e.g., Miller and Sag, 1997). In Italian, clitic climbing occurs with three types of verbs: (1) modals; (2) aspectual verbs; and (3) motion verbs (p. 136). It may also occur with auxiliary verbs, perceptual and causative verbs (p. 136, note 2), though M. does not examine the latter in her analysis. As noted above, Italian clitics, and clitic forms in general, frustrate precisely con- structed models of linguistic theory because they are at the boundary of three major 634 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 627-636 parts of grammar (syntax, morphology, phonology). M. recognizes this, and she has had to face this perplexing issue in her well-thought out discussion of these Italian forms. The linguist™s fascination with them derives from an essential inability to locate them in any one grammatical module without complicating grammatical the- ory. M.‚s treatment of Italian clitics within a lexicalist framework requires her to address certain problematic issues such as the treatment of these forms as affixes, and she manages to do so without straining credibility. This study is an excellent point of departure for the study of Italian clitics. I would envision it as a required text in a seminar on cliticization in general, or Italian or Romance cliticization. The extant literature on clitics features much metaphoric language to convey graphically the nature of these particles, e.g., Carstairs™ (1981: 3-4) mixed biologi- cal/maritime metaphors of ‚appendage™ and ‚anchor™, as well as his biological refer- ence to the clitic as ‚parasitic™. Likewise, M.‚s (pp. 2, 3, 22, 70) own use of the metaphor ‚host™ to which the clitic attaches itself is yet another instance of this bio- logical analogy (Nuessel, 1999, in press). A prefatory section contains a list of abbreviations (pp. xiii-xv). An appendix (pp. 203-223) features a listing of the possible clitic clusters contained in the Italian Ref- erence Corpus described as a reference that ﬁconsists of 13 million words from texts extracted from Italian newspapers, magazines, novels, short stories, handbooks, sci- entific texts and technical reportsﬂ (p. 203). M. further notes that ﬁ[i]t was sampled by the Institute for Computational Linguistics in Pisa in the period 1985-1989ﬂ (p. 203). This appendix is an invaluable resource for those with a less than perfect knowledge of Italian. Finally, a bibliography (pp. 225-237), a name index (pp. 239-241), and a subject index (pp. 243-247) complement this volume. References Anderson, S., 1992. A-morphous morphology.
