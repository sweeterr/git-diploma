Pandharipande™s (hereinafter P™s) book is a descriptive grammar of Marathi which follows a format designed for cross-linguistic comparability, based on a framework laid out by Comrie and Smith in Lingua, volume 42. The grammar™s format empha- sizes the description of cross-linguistically useful categories and distinctions in mor- phosyntax and phonology. A surprising feature of this format is the occasional appearance of statements like ﬁThe partitive-non-partitive distinction is not always expressed the same way as in Englishﬂ (p. 324), but perhaps the cost is justified for those in the linguistic typology and language universals business. Marathi is an important Indo-Aryan language which - though related and similar to the better-known (at least in the West) Hindi and Bengali - has a number of inter- esting features of its own. The language being described here is designated by P as ﬁthe standard variety of Marathi spoken around Puneﬂ (p. xlvii). However ‚standard™ may be defined, the examples show that the variety of Marathi presented here is a very elite form, as spoken by a small number of (mainly) highly-educated and upper- caste people, with a high level of awareness of Marathi™s relation to classical San- skrit, and a concern for preserving echoes of Sanskrit phonological distinctions and morphological processes. In discussing the origin of Marathi, P presents the standard view that the language is descended from western Prakrits (p. xxxvii), but also states that Marathi belongs to the ‚outer circle™ of Indo-Aryan languages posited by Grier- son (p. xliv). No explanation of the implications of these remarks is provided for the benefit of those not familiar with the history of Indo-Aryan, and no suggestion is given as to how these contradictory positions are to be reconciled. (Grierson™s ‚inner-outer™ classification groups the eastern and western IA languages against the northwestern and central.) No criteria are mentioned for the inclusion of Khan- deshi/Ahirani as a ‚dialect™ of Marathi (p. xxxiv), though some consider that it could better be grouped with Gujarati. What is new in this description is a wealth of detail on syntactic relations which has not been hitherto available in a single place, organized in a framework which, in 024-3841/00/$ - see front matter 0 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved PII: SOO24-3841(99)00020-0 P™s words, ﬁis uniform and is flexible enough to include adequately the range of variation across genetically and typologically unrelated languages and thereby allows crosslinguistic comparison of the structures/grammarsﬂ (p, xlvi). This goal has been largely accomplished, though there are some troublesome flaws - including omissions; unclear, incomplete, misleading, and/or incorrect descriptions; an unnec- essarily cumbersome transcription; and disturbingly frequent typographical and other errors both in the English text and the Marathi citations. Some examples are given below. 1. Phonology and transcription (pp. 537-576) Although the section on phonology comes at the end of the book, and is much smaller than the syntax and mo~hology sections, it is discussed first here because (1) the transcriptions appear t~ou~out the work, and (2) it is the weakest of the three sections. The transcription contains unnecessary phonetic details, while at the same time some details are not adequately specified. Vowel nasalization Though P states that ﬁthere are no inherently nasal vowels in contemporary Marathiﬂ, and ﬁ. . . nasalization [of vowels] is not phonemic in Standard Marathiﬂ (p. 544), she presents several cases - ~ewha~k~mwha-k~rnwh~-/ ‚when?™ (p. 545), the ﬁnasal diphthong I&/ which is restricted to loan words from Sanskritﬂ, e.g. in /h%s/ ‚swan™ (p. 545), and a few other items such as /my%V/ ‚cat™s purr™ [sic] and /8- h&l ‚sound of disapproval™ (p. 579), suggesting that vowel nasalization may be at least marginally distinctive. The situation is complicated by the statement that ﬁvowels are nasalized before nasal consonantsﬂ (p. 546), which is overgeneralized: according to P™s transcriptions, this rule appears to apply only to nasals followed by (homor- ganic) stops, though even these are not marked with 100% consistency (see e.g. santra ‚orange™, p. 553). In any case, since this nasalization is predictable, there is no need to indicate it in the transcription. Africates P treats the alveolar and palatal affricates as sequences Its dz dzh/ (alveolar) and /tS tSh dg dgh/ (palatal). There are good reasons to treat these as single units, which could be transcribed Ic j jh E Eh j JW: first of all, the voiced affricates at least vary phonetically between Pz(h) - z(h)/ and fdJ(h)- j(h}/. Secondly, all the so-called aff~ca~s~~c~io~ as single consonants word-finally in that they do not shorten pre- ceding high vowels (see below): thus the vowels of /tic/ ‚she (emphatic)‚, /vij/ ‚elec- tricity™, /kharbuj/ ‚melon™ and the like are phonetically long, like the vowels of /khup/ ‚much™, /lid/ ‚dung™, /pu$/ ‚rump™, /jibh/ ‚tongue™. In addition, P™s digraphic tran- scription leads to visual monstrosities like /katstsW ‚raw™ and /itStShd ‚desire™, and there is no indication of the actual phonemic or phonetic value of these words - which would be /kattsa ittS$ in her transcription, /katc% it&/ in mine. The statement ‚i . . . the contrast between alveolar and palatal affricates . . . is neutralized before /y/ Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 215-224 217 and /i/ and optionally before /e/l™ (p. xxxviii) is misleading; a more correct statement would be: the contrast between alveolar and palatal affricates is neutralized before non-low front vocalic segments /i e y/, with the palatal occurring before /i y/ and the alveolar and palatal in free variation before /e/. Length contrast in high vowels Marathi can be described with or without the length contrast in the vowels Ii/ and /u/, since the length is positionally determined - long in final syllables followed by 0 or C(h), short elsewhere - except for a small number of borrowed words such as /Irsa/ ‚jealousy™, /gati/ ‚speed™, words used primarily by highly educated speakers (a tiny percentage of the Marathi-speaking population), and perhaps mainly in the classroom, at least for those who are not linguists. In fact, P states that ﬁword-final short vowel /i/ is lengthened in words inherited or borrowed from Sanskritﬂ, for which she gives the examples /mati/ ‚intellect™ and /gati/ ‚speed™ (p. 569); see also 3.2.3.1 (section 552). Thus it is highly probable that the large majority of Marathi speakers, including many educated individuals, lack a length contrast in these vowels. For the elite variety P is describing, it is perhaps debatable whether it is more economical to consider length as contrastive or non-contrastive, but it is certainly more convenient to trun- scribe the language without the contrast, and to indicate length only when necessary - e.g. I™lrs%/, /gati/ (e.g. when referring to the actual speech of elite speakers). Among other advantages, this would eliminate the need for the section which deals with length alternations produced by suffixation (e.g. /mul/ [mu:11 ‚child™, /mula/ [mula:] ‚children™ (p. 564), as well as the separate discussion of the deletion of long high vow- els (p. 571) which would be covered by the section on short vowel deletion (p. 572). Final [a] and [a:] P uses /al to represent the non-final vowels in words such as /anti/ (anu: ] ‚Anu™ (name), /mad [ma:g] ‚then™, ldzawall [dzawa:U ‚near™, as well as the (phonologi- cally predictable) short final [a] in words like /bhakta/ [bhakta] ‚devotee™, /bhintal [bhinta] ‚wall™, lpatral [patra] ‚letter™ and the lengthened [a:] of words like ldzanal [dza:na:] ‚to go, going™, /dzhada/ [dzha:da:] ‚trees™, /patra/ [patra:] ‚letters™, laga/ [aga:] (vocative particle). Thus P™s treatment fails in the first place to indicate some direct contrasts, such as the difference between [patra] ‚letter™ (sg.) and [patra:] ‚letters™ (~1.). It would be possible to treat the (predictable) short final [a] as phone- mically 0 and write lpatrl (sg.), lpatra/ (~1.). On the other hand, since most cases of final [a:] have a more formal variant in /e/ [e:], it would be useful to indicate this fact by using a separate symbol for final [a:], instead of randomly alternating between /a/ and /e/, which could be confusing for the reader. The [a:] in these cases is not ﬁa free variant of the vowel lelﬂ, as P states (p. 542), but rather, as she shows in section 3.4.1.3.4 (pp. 567-569), a morphophonemic variant of certain suffixes in /e/. Thus I would suggest /bhakta/ ‚devotee™, /patra/ ‚letter™, /jana/ ‚to go™, ljhadal ‚trees™, lpatral ‚letters™. Other minor features which confuse the transcription: ( 1) 4 -. Though listed as a positional realization of In/ (p. 541) [nl appears frequently in the transcriptions, e.g. 218 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 21.5-224 /mungus/ ‚mongoose™, /doggar/ (typographical error for /dorJgarf) ‚hill™ (p. 546). (2) r -. This symbol, found in words like /hrday/ ‚heart™ (p. 598) and /prthwi/ ‚earth™ (p. 597), is mentioned neither in the inventory of distinctive phonological segments (538-544) nor in the chart of the Marathi alphabet (pp. xlvii-xlviii). It represents the standard transcription of a Sanskrit ‚vocalic r™, whose pronunciation in Sanskrit is subject to debate, but which is pronounced /ru/ when it occurs in Marathi: thus /hru- day/ ‚heart™, lpruthwil ‚earth™. (3) F -. The segment Is/, as in /satkon/ ‚hexagon™, Jdosl ‚drawback, fault ™ ﬁis a voiceless retroflex (apico-post alveolar) sibilant . . . largely restricted to Sanskrit vocabularyﬂ (p. 541) - and probably restricted to class- room pronunciation as well, even for educated speakers. Most do not distinguish /s/ from /s/, though many do learn to write the difference in Marathi script. (4) Doubled aspirated consonants, as in /makhkha/ ‚foolish™ (p. 549), are again visually odd as well as phonetically misleading. They are better represented as CCh, viz. /makkha/. Ho+hw+wh P™s rules for this morphonemic change (schematically, (o + w /h_(C)%; hw -+ wh}) cover her examples /na-ho-G/ + /nawht%/, /ho-%/ + /wha/ (566), but do not cover some other cases of fhof + fhwl --+ lwhl, such as lnawhtol ‚I was not™ t lna- ho-t-o/. In addition, P™s rules predict forms which do not occur - e.g. /ho-n%+/ (be-pr. ppl.) +*/whr@r/. A closer approximation to a correct rule would be: ho -+ wh /#_V, /V_X (where X = any phonological segment other than + or # juncture). Assimilation Though section 3.4.1.1. on assimilatory processes includes processes which exist in Sanskrit, such as nasal assimilation (e.g. /bhagawat+nam + bhagawannam/ ‚god™s name™, p. 563) which could probably better be treated as single lexical items in Marathi, at least one native Marathi process has been omitted: {s + S /_i,y } ; thus, khis-ya-t (pocket-oblique-in) -+ khiSat ‚in pocket™, kas-i (how-fsg.) -+ kaSi ‚how, what kind of?‚. 2. Syntax (pp. l-272) The sections on syntax, which occupy nearly half of the book, are on the whole straightforward and highly informative, and presumably useful for the intended audi- ence of the series - which I take to be primarily students of language universals and linguistic typology. Other users might include teachers of Marathi, if they have suf- ficient linguistic training and tenacity. While there are significant omissions as well as occasionally unclear, misleading, and/or incorrect statements, many of the ques- tions which such users may ask about Marathi surface structure will be answered sat- isfactorily within these pages, by use of the systematically organized table of con- tents (pp. ix-xxvi) and the subject index (pp. 614-630) - though the latter is not complete and contains some errors in page numbers. I have not made a complete search of the index, but noticed the absence of entries for Argument, Habitual, Irreg- ular, Non-finite forms, Participles, Phrase structure, and Sentence structure. The Book review i Lingua II0 (2OoOj 215-224 219 index also contains no Marathi words, even those like lpahul or /bara/ (see pp. 54- 55) which play important grammatical roles. In searching for a discussion of basic sentence structure, the index was not helpful: the entry for Sentence types (pp. 1-61) refers to a section dealing with question types only; under Word order, the reference ‚in main clauses 23™ leads to a section entitled ‚Constituents of noun phrases that can be questioned™. In this case I would have done better to scan the table of contents first; there it was, under 1.21. ‚Internal structure of the sentence™. Following are some examples of problems in the descriptive statements in this section. Subject of sentence The discussion of the subject category (p. 129ff.) is confusing and incomplete. It starts with an example of subject deletion: /t-o kll a-l-a/ (Dem-Msg. yesterday come-Pst-Msg.)+ /0 kal ala/ ‚(he) came yesterday™ (p. 129). The identity of the subject is recoverable from context and from formal clues (in this case the verbal Msg. ending). The situation is clear until the following statement is encountered: ﬁThe evidence for this deletion comes from the fact that if the deleted subject is assumed to be other than to ‚he™, . . . the sentence becomes ungrammatical since the agreement features indicate that the implied subject ought to be ‚he™ ﬂ (p. 129). If a grammatical sentence is subjected to a permitted deletion, how does the sen- tence then ‚become™ ungrammatical? Is it implied that a person hearing the above sentence, and believing the subject to be someone other than /to/ ‚he™, may accuse the speaker of uttering an ungr~matical sentence ? Or is it the hearer™s interpre- tution which is ‚ungrammatical™ ? However this conundrum may be resolved, it seems an unnecessarily complicated way of restating something that was already fairly clear. The section continues with a discussion of sentences with ergative agreement. (Would it not be simpler to say that all ergative subjects take the Agentive postposi- tion, which appears as 181 after 1st and 2nd person subjects, a statement which accords with the historical facts - rather than saying that only 3rd~person subjects take the Agentive suffix, which requires stating the agreement rules twice?) P states: ﬁIf the direct object is followed by a postposition, the verb remains in its unmarked form . . . The following examples illustrate this: ﬂ (p. 130). But the following exam- ples only illustrate ergative cases with direct object agreement. In addition, there is no example of deletion of ergative subjects, leaving it unclear whether a subject noun such as /tyani/ in /tyl-ni k&n kela/ (he-Ag. work did) ‚he did (the) work/he worked™, can be deleted. Word order On p. 16 a formula is given which purports to show ﬁthe unmarked order of sen- tences with adverbial question words: Subject (+ Direct Object) (+ Indirect Object) + Adverbial Question + Verb; but the only examples of sentences with adverbial questions in this section contain no objects, and the only preceding examples with objects have the order S + IO + DO + V (e.g. /mohan dipala payse detol ‚Mohdn gives money to Dipa™), which P notes elsewhere (p. 138) as the default order. The statement ﬁThe copular verb is obligatorily retained in the positive/affi~atjve sen- 220 Book review I Lingua 110 (2ooOj 215-224 tenceﬂ (p. 126) seems to ignore a type of sentence exemplified by /ha majha bhBu/ ‚this (is) my brother™ or /tumhi ken/ ‚who (are) you?‚, found frequently in informal conversation and in dramatic writing. Relativization In discussing the constituents of a main clause which can be relativized by par- ticipial clauses (pp. 89-91), P states that ﬁ... the deletion of the relativized noun phrase along with its case markings and postpositions creates ambiguity regarding grammatical relations within the relative clause. Hence . . . the constraints on rela- tivization are not grammatical but pragmatic. Since the relativized Np is absent and the site of deletion is not marked, it is only the pragmatics of the situation which indicates the thematic roles of the constituentsﬂ (p. 89). It would be useful to have examples here, since the implications of this passage are unclear (at least to me). Under what circumst~ces is the relativized Np deleted? No examples of this are given. Though the statement is made that ﬁExcept object of the postposition, any con- stituent of the main clause can be relativized by a PRCﬂ [participial relative clause] (p. 89), not all possibilities are illustrated. Among other omissions, there are no examples of relativization of ablative or genitive phrases (ablative and gen- itive are defined as cases on pp. 273-274, not postpositions). The examples use the present participle V-gar-C, as in /g@a mhan%r-i [typo for mhan-@r-i] mulgif (= song recite-pr.ppl.-C girl) ‚a/the girl who is singing (a song)‚, and the past partici- ple -lel-C, as in /tu pathaw-lel-i sadi/ (thou sent-pst.ppl.-C sari) ‚a/the sari you sent™. However, no mention is made of the fact that the former is usually active and the latter normally passive in meaning, implying a difference in their privi- leges of occurrence. Thus while the use of the past passive participle to relativize the subject of an intransitive verb, as in /kil a-Bela m8nus/ (yesterday come- pst.pp1.C man) ‚the/a man who came yesterday™, or the object of a transitive verb, as in ftyani car-lel-e paisel (by-him steal-pst.ppl.-C money} ‚the money he stole™, are both probably acceptable to most Marathi speakers, its use to relativize the subject of a transitive verb, as in /paise car-lel-2 manus/ (money steal-pst.pp1.C man) ‚the/a man who stole (the) money™, seems to be of questionable acceptability to many (based on my own data). The exploration of this point is of particular importance for comparison with other South Asian languages, particularly Dravid- ian languages. truncated answers to q~estjons ﬁAnswers to question-word questions usually consist of only the constituent required by the question. The rest of the sentence is generally deleted on the assumption that the questioner already has the information conveyed by itﬂ (p. 41). While this statement may be true - and we must assume that the qualifiers ‚usu- ally™ and ‚generally™ are P™s personal judgments, since no reference is made to sociolinguistic or statistical studies - it is also the case that Marathi speakers some- times (based on my own data) add the verb in such answers. For example, in answer to Book review I Linguu 110 (2000) 215-224 221 tu kona-la paise di-l-e-s thou who-to money give-past-C™-2s ‚to whom did you give money? ™ (Pandharipande, p. 4 l), Some Marathi speakers in some contexts may respond anu-la di-l-e Anu-dat give-pst-C (To Anu gave) = ‚(I) gave it to Anu.™ Whatever the relative frequency of the two types of response may be, such a point is worth mentioning, especially in a work designed for the use of students of language universals. It would also have been useful to mention that the same type of redun- dancy-reduction strategy applies in questions of the type illustrated on pp. 16-20 (constituents of the main clause that can be questioned): thus a sentence like /mohan konala udya salet hindi+ca pustak deil/ (Mohan who-to tomorrow school-in Hindi- Gen. book give-Fut.) ‚to whom will Mohan give the Hindi book tomorrow in school?™ (p. 17) would be unlikely to occur in this full form, but rather in truncated form - e.g. /konal%/ ‚to whom?™ or /konala deil/ ‚will give to whom? ™ or /mohan pustak konala deil/ ‚to whom will M. give the book?‚, etc. Deletion and word order There is no adequate treatment of noun/Np deletion, or of word order variation. Pronoun deletion is discussed briefly, and a made-up passage is offered as illustra- tion (pp. 378-380). Unfortunately it will be difficult for readers to match the zeros in the Marathi text with the pronouns in the English translation, partly because they occur in different orders, and also because some zeros are missing in the Marathi (e.g. a 0 for /tyZi/ ‚his™ before /bayko/), and some are misplaced (e.g. the 0 repre- - - senting /tyaca/ ‚his™ is before /don/ in line 4, instead of before /ek/ in 1.5. Contrastive use of word order is mentioned in several places (pp. 16, 185-186, 223, 234, and 243-244, and perhaps elsewhere), but with a focus on specific examples and with no attempt to give a general picture of the kinds of emphasis conveyed by word or con- stituent movement. The examples on pp. 243-244 are not particularly convincing, since they all involve the time adverb /kal/ ‚yesterday™, which along with other time adverbs generally can be moved freely to several different slots without significantly altering the meaning (unless contrastive stress and/or particles are added). Restrictive vs. non-restrictive relative clauses The discussion of this topic (pp. 80-84) uses a lot of verbiage and ends up saying essentially that the distinction is not relevant in Marathi - more accurately, that the interpretation depends on context and the hearer™s knowledge and beliefs more than ™ C = concord suffix showing gender (MFN) and number (Sg-PI) agreement 222 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 215-224 any formal cues, though some preferential interpretations are suggested for particu- lar collocations. The erroneous statement ﬁ. . . when the head noun is . . . a proper noun . . . it is always non-restrictiveﬂ (p. 80), with the example /mohan jo salet Sikawto to majjha mitra %he/ (Mohan Rel-Msg. school-in teaches he my friend is) ﬁMohan, who teaches (in the) school, is my friendﬂ, is not clarified until four pages later: ﬁHowever, if more than one individual with the same proper name is known to the speaker and the hearer, then the use of a proper noun . . .ﬂ [will not inhibit a restrictive interpretation] (p. 84). Grammaticality and real life The materials in this section are (apparently) culled largely from the author™s brain, since there are no references to any recorded conversational data or written texts, or even to the testing of sample sentences against other speakers™ intuitions. This is of course a feature of certain contemporary approaches to descriptivism, for which P cannot be held responsible. Occasionally some citations seem to stretch the limits of plausibility, however. What can we make of a sentence like the following? /je ambe wikt@.ri mulgi m%jhi se jarin tie te (ambe) god abet/ (Rel. mangoes selling girl my neighbor is Correl. (mangoes) are sweet) ‚the mangoes which the girl who sells is my neighbor are sweet™ (p. 99). (Note that this is not the same as ‚the mangoes which the girl who is my neighbor sells . . . ‚. ) We have the author™s word that this is a gram- matical sentence, but what is the probability that anyone would ever say such a thing in real life? Is there a context in which such an utterance is likely to occur - given that there are at least 6 simpler ways I can think of for getting this message across? If asked to judge its acceptability, how many Marathi speakers would respond with the equivalent of ‚huh?™ Though I am not a native speaker, and thus have no relevant intuitions, in 40 years of studying and reading Marathi I do not recall encountering such an utterance. (It seems to me it would have been a memorable event!) In cases like these, it seems to me that we catch a glimpse of descriptivism unhinged - of a vast abyss in which float an infinity of unutterably grammatical utterances like ‚the sentences which the woman who makes up is my colleague are strange™ . . . Miscellaneous points The first sentence in this section begins ﬁDirect and indirect speech is generally marked...ﬂ (p. 1); this should be corrected to ‚Indirect speech is generally marked 9 . . . The first word in ﬁto na, ho naﬂ (p. 9) should be unitalicized, since it is the Eng- lish ‚to™ and not the Marathi /to/. The word ‚optional™ should be replaced by ‚equivalent™ in the following passage: ﬁWhile the traditional grammars . . . treat the postpositions -la and -ne as optional in this construction, . . . ﬂ (p. 50). Some English translations of Marathi examples could be improved - for example, ﬁWho did Sudha see Madhu and?ﬂ (p. 31) would be better rendered as ‚Sudha saw Madhu and who?‚. ﬁHis seeing whom do you not like?ﬂ (p. 23) + ‚Who don™t you like him looking at? . ™ ﬁThe letter which and a book is on the table is written by meﬂ (p. 102) + ‚The letter which is on the table with a book . ..‚. Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 215-224 223 3. ~orphoI~y (pp. 273476) Compared to the section on syntax, there is less new material here, though it is perhaps useful to have it all in one place. Again, there are some gaps and some mis- statements. Among missing items are the present participle V-n&r-Concord, though the form is used in a number of citations in the syntax section, such as /ambe wik- @r-i mulgil (mangoes sell-ing-C girl) ‚girl who sells mangoes™ (p. 99). Neuter forms are missing from the present (p. 409) and the past intransitive (p. 412) paradigms. There is no listing of the paradigmatic forms of the copular/auxiliary verb /as/, though forms of this verb appear on nearly every page. In this connection, an inter- esting passage is the following: ﬁThe non-habitual/progressive aspect is expressed by using the existential form of the copula as ‚to be™ (refer to verb mo~holo~ sec- tion) . ..ﬂ (p. 4231, where the parenthetical remark seems to be a reminder to the author. (The passage occurs in the verb morphology section.) The statement that ﬁ[a]s far as the present, past, and future markers are concerned, there are no irregular verbs in Marathiﬂ (p. 408) is surprising, since Marathi has a few dozen verbs with non-predictable allomorphs occurring before the past suffix a/, such as /j&f ‚go™ - Ige-1-l ‚went™, /ho/ ‚become™ - /jha-1-l ‚became™. Many of these irregular forms occur in P™s citations, but I have found no listing of them. (Searching is difficult, given the lack of relevant index entries.) In the discussion of the present progressive tense (pp. 423424), two cases of contraction of the imperfective verb form with a following copula are noted: /kartey/ + /kar-t-e+ahe/ (do-Imp.-C+is) ‚she is doing™, and /kart&etl [colloquial also /kartayt/] t ~~-it+~he-~ (do-Imp.-is-Pl.) ‚they are doing™ (p. 424); these are followed by the comment ﬁ[t]he above merger is possible in the rest of the forms as wellﬂ (p. 424), leaving readers to generate the remaining forms, such as /kartoy/ ‚he is doing™, /kartaht/ ‚you are doing™, etc., for themselves - which may be difficult, since the underlying forms are not listed. Vari- ation in the form of a suffix is omitted in two cases: (1) the ordinal numerals above /p&w%/ ‚fifth™ ﬁ. . . are formed by adding the suffix -wti to a cardinal number . . . ﬂ (p. 455). This statement fails to mention that the final -/a/ in I-wZt/ is the gender-num- ber agreement suffix (thus more correctly (-w-C)). and also neglects the variant form (-SW-C}, which occurs for example in /wis-aw5/ ‚20th™. (2) For ﬁthe emphatic parti- cle -hi™, examples such as don-hi ‚both™ and d$z-ahi ‚all eight™ are given (p. 4561, with no indication of the distribution of the two alternant forms of the suffix. Time reference ﬁThe verb form . . . in the matrix sentence or the main clause provides the time reference for the entire sentence (including the subordinate/embedded clause). For example, the main as well as the subordinate clause in (1177) below refer to past tense/time regardless of the fact that the embedded subordinate clause is in the pre- sent tense. (1177) anU mhat$i-l-i ki manju hindi Sikaw-t-e Anu say-pst-C that Manju Hindi teach-pres-C ‚Anu said that Manju taught Hindi.™ ﬂ (p. 407) 224 Book review i Lingua I10 {2ooO)215-224 Perhaps the author has confused past time with the past tense of the English ‚taught™ in her translation. (The sentence could equally well be translated ﬁAnu said that Manju teaches Hindi™.) In fact, the time reference of the subordinate clause /manju hindi Sikawtel ‚Manju teaches Hindi™ is extended present (present time extended indefinitely into the past and future), both in the original and reported state- ments. If the statement quoted above were true, it would mean that in a sentence like /anu mhan-t-e ki manju ge-l-i (Arm say-pres-C that Manju go-pst-C) ‚Anu says that Manju left™, the final verb must be interpreted as referring to present time, which is clearly not the case. 4. Summary This book is a significant addition to the ~~atical rnate~~s on Marathi, and will be particularly useful for students of typological linguistics and syntactic uni- versals. Users will need to beware of some pitfalls: incomplete, unclear, and incor- rect statements, typographical errors, inadequate indexing, the elite dialect, and the non-empirical nature of the data. The syntactic materials are the most useful. The gaps and inadequacies in the phonological and morphological sections make this less than an ideal reference grammar for general purposes.
