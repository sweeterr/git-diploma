Reviewed by Frank Nuessel, Department of Classical and Modem Languages, Program in Linguistics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292, USA. The twenty-sixth annual meeting of the Linguistic Symposium on Romance Lan- guages ~hencefo~h LSRL) took place in Mexico City March Z&30,1996 at La Casa de La Primera lmprenta de America (‚house of the first printing press in America™) at the Universidad Autbnoma Metropolitana-lztupufapa. This well-known and very prestigious North American linguistic conference usually meets at a major university in the United States. LSRL XXVI marks only the fourth time that this organization has met, either entirely, or in part, outside the confines of the U.S. Past meetings held beyond the U. S. borders include: (1) LSRL VI (Montreal, Quebec, 1976); (2) LSRL XX (Ottawa, Ontario, 1990); (3) LSRL XXII (held jointly in El Paso, TX and Ciudad Juzirez, Mexico, 1992). Editors Lema and Trevifio report that they received 130 abstracts with topics on phonology, syntax, phonology-mo~hology, the syntax- semantics interface, language acquisition, and sociolinguistics (p. v). Moreover, the two editors state that ﬁUnlike previous LSRL events, a high number of papers in phonology were presented, an area that has remained marginally present in LSRL tradition. Nonetheless, due to a rich set of native existent lan- guages in Mexico, the phonology sessions had a great impact especially amongst the mexican [sic] lin- guists, but also among the general attending participants at the Conference. Papers on first and second language acquisition wem also high in number according to usual standards, and we think that this fact contributed significantly to realize among the audience the importance of including in events such as this on, research problems directly dealt with from an acquisition perspective.ﬂ (p. v) Lema and Treviiio also note that ﬁMost of the grammatical phenomena dealt with in the articles in this volume are worked in the light of the ~i~~rnaIis~ Program, the Distributed Morphology, and the ~Ftirn~~~~ Theory frameworks. These recent theoretical developments have motivated reconsidering known or previously discussed grammat- 0024.3841/00/$ - see front matter 0 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Likewise, these developments have greatly contributed to gaining new insights and better explanations for a wide range of phenomena. It was apparent from the diversity of the papers delivered, that these approaches are opening up new venues to inquiry, as well as exposing novel phenomena, which, no doubt, enrich and widen our knowl- edge and understanding of language.ﬂ (pp. v-vi) The 29 authors (two papers had five authors each, and three had two authors each) of the 18 essays in this selected proceedings anthology have academic affiliations in the U.S., Canada, and Spain. No paper, however, from any professor of any univer- sity in Mexico had a paper included in this volume. The languages represented included Aromanian (1 paper), French (3 papers), Italian (1 paper), Italian and French (1 paper), Latin and Gallo-Romance (1 paper), Latin and Romance (1 paper), Romanian (1 paper), Spanish (6 papers), Spanish and Catalan (2 papers), Spanish and Italian (1 paper). These 18 papers deal with phonology and/or morphology (5 papers), syntax/semantics (13 papers). The first chapter (‚Genitives in Aromanian dialects™, pp. 1-21) by Antonia Androutsopoulou deals with this grammatical form in the Aromanian dialects spoken in Greece as well as the dialect of Krugevo in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In a thorough review of the genitive syntagm, the author concludes that she has *‚provided a set of syntactic operations that allows us to formulate the following generalization with respect to raising-to-D movement and genitive Case assi~ment in Arom~ian and Rum~ian: (1) a. prepositionless genitive occurs iff N-to-D raising takes place, and b. prepositional (a-) genitive occurs when noun raising to D pied-pines a larger projection con- taining the noun Aromanian genitives which apparently involve overt N-to-D, but obligatorily require the preposition a (lack of prepositionless genitives) are problematic for [la]. [lb] allows for an account of Aromanian genitives and also for a unified account of Aromanian genitives and Rumanian genitives requiring the presence of a.ﬂ (p. 19) In chapter 2 (‚On optionality in the Minimalist Program and Old French word order™, pp. 23-34), Deborah Arteaga examines old French word order within Chom- sky™s (1995) Minimalist Program. The author, whose work (Arteaga, 1994, 1996) in various aspects of Old French syntax is already well-regarded, concludes that ﬁThis paper has considered various Old French word orders which illustrate the optional nature of sub- ject and object raising in that language. We have argued that this variety provides support of Marantz™ (1995) proposal of V and D-features that may be optionally strong or weak in a given language. We have further argued that according to our proposal, language change should be viewed as a change in the rel- ative strength of features.ﬂ (p. 32) The next chapter (‚Interactions between pragmatic and syntactic knowledge in the first language acquisition of Spanish null and overt pronominals™, pp. 35-5 1) by Jen- nifer Austin, Maria Blume, David Parkinson, Zelmira Nufiez de1 Prado, and Barbara Lust present the results of a study of Spanish first language acquisition based on the analyses of young children™s natural speech. Ult~ately, the authors conclude that Book review I Linpa 110 (2000) 225-234 227 ﬁThe primary result of the research reported here is a change of focus from the way in which null sub- jects have been investigated previously. If we had limited ourselves to looking at the purely syntactic aspects of the use of pro-drop in our subjects, we would have seen very little development, since their syntactic knowledge is so good from the beginning. Only by looking at the wider discourse context have we found where development is taking place; that is, in language specific interactions between syntax and pragmatics which must be learned.ﬂ (p. 45) The fourth chapter (‚The myth of equivalence: Where two lights do not make a long™, pp. 53-70) is by Barbara E. Bullock, who notes that current research argues for strict binarism and evenness in the foot (Hayes, 19X.5, 1995; Hyman, 1977; Prince, 1990). She argues against this position based on data from Italian, a quantity- sensitive language and French, a supposedly quantity-insensitive language (Halle and Vergnaud, 1987). Ultimately, the author concludes that ﬁWhile an uneven trochaic foot surfaces generally in Italian and French, many processes in these lan- guages conspire to eliminate that type of foot. In no case, however, do they do so by trying to restore trochaic unevenness. Rather, both Italian and French take a single unary syllable to be equivalent to a binary, uneven foot. French schwa deletion, along with the shortened and argotic forms, show that Stan- dard French often prefers to close a syllable by a consonant rather than permit a schwa, and by extension an uneven foot, in the output. In Italian, a series of final vowel deletions display a parallel behavior to that of French; that is, Italian permits a sonorant coda, eliminates a posttonic vowel and consequently shortens the foot.ﬂ (p. 68) Chapter 5 (‚Some remarks on the Latin case system and its development in Romance™, pp. 71-126) by Andrea Calabrese is the longest in the entire anthology. After a detailed analysis of the evolution of the Latin case system into the various Romance languages with their reduced or abandoned case systems, Calabrese con- cludes that ﬁMy analysis is based on the idea that Case systems are strnctured in the same way as phonological sys- tems. In particular, they are governed by Case restrictions that disallow the combinations of certain case features. Simplifications in the structure of Case systems involve the activation of Case restrictions. An active Case restriction disallows a given feature combination in tlte feature bundles of the terminal nodes provided by the syntax. Disallowed feature bundles can be repaired either by changing one of the disal- lowed features or by fissioning it. Both strategies were used in the historical development of the Latin Case system. Fission accounts for the appearance prepositions at a stage when Latin Case [Bittner and Hale, 19961 phrases were consistently head final. Feature change accounts for simple Case syncretism. By the combined effect of these two strategies, I have shown how the five Case Latin system was reduced to a three Case system in proto-Romance by el~inating the ablative and the dative. I have then showed how this three Case system evolved differently in western and eastern Romance, and why the plural morphemes in languages such as French, Spanish and Portuguese are etymologically based on the Latin accusative, whereas the plural morphemes of a language like Italian are etymologically based on the Latin nominative.ﬂ (pp. 123-124) The author employs theoretical notions developed by and Hjelmslev (1935) as well as more recent work by Bittner and Hale (1996) for Case and work by Halle and Marantz (1993) for Distributed Morphology. The following chapter (‚The Wh-feature and the syntax of restrictive and non- restrictive relatives in French and English™, pp. 127-141) by Rejean Canac Marquis and Mireille Tremblay deals with ﬁ[t]wo types of relative clauses that have been 228 Book review i Lingua 1 IO ~2~~ 225-234 identified in the literature: restrictive relatives such as those in [2a], which restrict the reference of the antecedent, and appositive relatives such as [2b] which do notﬂ (p. 127). (2) a. The woman (whom/that) Mary saw works at UQAM. b. Marianne, who Mary saw, works at UQAM. (p. 127) The authors point out that ﬁ[a] number of syntactic and semantic arguments have been put forth in favor of a non-unified analysis of restrictive and appositive rela- tives. However, this paper claims that there is only one type of relative clause, which is restrictive, and that the observed differences follow from independant [sic] con- straints on the identification of null pronominals and the syntax of unmerged objectsﬂ (p. 127). In the rest of this paper, Rejean Canac and Tremblay provide rea- sonable evidence for their ﬁanalysis of appositive relatives as restrictive relatives with a covert headﬂ (p. 131). This assertion is based, among other things, ﬁ 1) the obligatory presence of a Wh-element; 2) the structural adjacency of the antecedent; 3) the impossibility to stack or extrapose themﬂ (p. 13 1; see van Riemsdijk and Williams, 1986; Kayne, 1994). In the seventh chapter (‚A constraint-based approach to Spanish spirantization™, pp. 143-157), Maria M. Carreira notes that ﬁSpanish spirantization, the alternation between voiced obstruents stops and fricatives, has been the subject of countless papers and discussionsﬂ (p. 143). The author, however, assures the reader that ﬁ[tlhis paper will differ from previous work on this topic in two important ways; first, in the theoretical model employed, in this case, Optimal@ Theory, and second, in the data under considerationﬂ (p. 143). The author bases her analysis, in part, on work developed by Padgett (1991, 1994, 1995). As she states, her theoretical frame- work is Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolenski, 1993; Itci et al., 1995). She con- cludes that her constraint-based approach accounts for both the variant and invariant dis~bution of this phonologic~ phenomenon (p. 155). Chapter 8 (‚A syntactic account of perfective and possessive verb selection in Romance languages™, pp. 159-174) by Juan Carlos Castillo states that ﬁ[t]he goal of this paper is to show that copulas, auxiliary verbs in perfective tenses, and posses- sive verbs are formed in the morphology and do not have their own lexical entriesﬂ (p. 159). Castillo structures his argumentation in the following way ﬁSection 1 will study the analysis of perfective tenses in general, and Section 2 wili talk about the aux- iliary verb ‚have™ in particular. Section 3 will consider an analysis of the possessive verb in its different versions. Section 4 will discuss auxiliary selection in some Romance languages. Finaily, Section 5 will be devoted to issues of learnability of the parameters involved in the analysis.ﬂ (p. 140) In the next chapter (‚Two types of predicate modification: Evidence from the articulated adjectives of Romanian,™ pp. 175-192) Domnita Dumitrescu and Mario Saltarelli note that ﬁ[almong the Romance languages Romanian is unique in exhibit- ing definite modified nominal constructions in which either the noun or the modifier incorporates a definite article in the form of an enclitically bound morphemeﬂ (p. 175). Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 225-234 229 Chapter 10 (‚Alignment and sonority in the syllable structure of Late Latin and Gallo-Romance™, pp. 193-204) by Randall S. Gess ﬁprovides an Optimality Theory (OT) treatment of two types of simplification in the syllable structure of Late Latin and Gallo-Romance . . . The reduction of complex codas is seen as resulting from an alignment requirement, while the elimination or sonorization of simple obstruent codas is described as a sonority-based constraint on which segments could be moraicﬂ (p. 191). In part, this study is a reflection of the author™s own doctoral dis- sertation (Gess, 1996) and the theoretical work of Sherer (1994). Chapter 11 (‚Locality and temporal weak proforms™, pp. 205-225) is by Javier Gutierrez Rexach and Luis Silva Villar, who argue that ﬁIn general, locative and temporal proforms can be classified, as either weak or strong from the prosodic point of view Strong forms can receive phrasal stress, whereas weak forms are never assigned phrasal stress . . the strong proform [a.i [= &Cl] is bisyllabic whereas the weak form is monosyllabic ([aj]). In parallel, the strong profonn [a.o.ra [= ahora]] is trisyllabic, contrasting with the weak [aoral, which is bisyllabic. Notice also the contrast in the stress pattern. There are also other temporal weak proforms, such as ya or sun [sun] (vs. the prosodically strong alin [a.tin].).ﬂ (p. 205) After presenting some persuasive data and arguments for their position, Gutierrez Rexach and Silva-Villar conclude that ﬁModern Spanish has prosodically weak and strong temporal/locative proforms. The weak proforms are cliticsﬂ (p. 223). The twelfth chapter (‚Optimalizing Iberian clitic sequences™, pp. 227-248) by David Heap points out that ﬁ[tlhe internal ordering of clitic pronoun sequences has been a matter of vigorous debate for over 25 years, without a widespread consensus being reached. While derivational or principle-based approaches to this problem do not cover the attested data, template or surface structure approaches are uncon- strained and ultimately predict nothing, and both have difficulty when faced with nonstandard and variable sequencesﬂ (p. 227). Many linguists have addressed the ordering of clitic sequences in the Romance languages (Perhnutter, 1971; Dinnsen, 1972; Szabo, 1974; Hetzron, 1977; Wanner, 1977) as surface structure constraints. Still other linguists have considered the sequence of pronominal clitics as a purely syntactic issue (Bastida, 1976; Laen- zlinger, 1993; Uriagereka, 1995). More recently, Bonet (1991, 1995a,b) and Nadasdi (1995) again use templates to describe the distribution of pronominal sequences. Finally, Harris (1994) uses precedence conditions within the Distributed Morphol- ogy framework for the same purpose. Following Heap et al. (1993), Cummins and Roberge (1994), Auger (1994), Bessler (1994), and Nadasdi (1995), the author assumes that ﬁthe mechanisms available in syntax and phonology are insufficient to account for the types of surface configuration attested in Romance varieties, and that it would be undesirable to extend the power and purview of these modules to cover such phenomena, in that it would simultaneously clutter up their respective for- malisms with otherwise unmotivated ad hoc processes, and reduce their explanatory value by making them so powerful as to be vacuous (Harris, 1994)ﬂ (p. 228). As a result, Heap proposes an Optimality Theory account of the complex sequences of Iberian clitics in that he employs a set constraints-based statements about their ordering. 230 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 225-234 Chapter 13 (‚The development of proclitics and enclitics in Middle French™, pp. 249-262) by Ken Johnson studies cliticization in Old French and concludes that ﬁAgr may have had a crucial role in determining how the OF enclitics went along separate paths of grammaticalization in MidF. The post-verbal subject pronouns encliticized to C may have developed an early relationship to Agr because of incorporation in OF and so grammaticalized more quickly at an ear- lier stage. The pre-verbal subject pronouns did not grammaticalize at the same rate, but they may have attached to Agr at some later time, particularly in the spoken language.ﬂ (p. 261). In the next chapter (‚Licensing and identification of null categories in Spanish non-native grammars™, pp. 263-282), Juana M. Liceras, Biana Laguardia, Zara Fer- n&rdez, Raquel Fernandez, and Lourdes Dfaz state that ﬁIn this paper we incorporate recent reformulations of the null-argument parameter to provide a compe- tence account of null subjects in Spanish non-native grammars of speakers of Indo-European and Orien- tal languages. Central to the proposals are: 1) the need to refer to three different levels of structure (VP, IP and CP) as the locus for licensing, and 2) the identification requirements. Assuming that adult L2 learners access UC principles (directly or via Ll) but do not reset parameters, and assuming that licens- ing is related to parametrization, we would like to argue that non-native null arguments are not sensitive to licensing requirements but only to identification principles.ﬂ (p. 263) Chapter 15 (‚On the spelling distinction B vs. U/V and the status of spirantization in Old Spanish™, pp. 283-316) by Fernando Martinez-Gil discusses the prevailing view of the Old Spanish consonant system and he holds that it ﬁexhibited the phonemic distinction shown in [3] between the voiced oral stops, derived historically by intervocalic VOI(CING) of Latin voiceless stops /p, t, k/, and their fricative counterparts, derived by intervocalic SPIR(ANTIZATION) of Latin intervocalic voiced stops /b, d, gJ [Martinet, 1951-1952; Alarcos Llorach, 1974; Lozano, 1979; Lloyd, 19861.ﬂ (p. 283) (3) /b, d, g/ - /b> d. g/ (p. 284) Martinez-Gil notes that ﬁthroughout the Old Spanish period and until the 15th cen- tury, the grapheme b was consistently used to represent the historical reflex of Latin intervocalic lpf . . . while u or v stood for the spirant reflex of both the labiovelar glide /w/ and intervocalic /b/ . . . ﬂ (p. 284). In the remainder of this paper, the author argues against what he calls the ‚Stop-Spirant Contrast Hypothesis™ (p. 284). More- over, Martinez-Gil proposes an alternative consistent with the recorded historical data as interpreted by Alonso (1949, 1967). In the next chapter (‚PPs without Ps in spoken Rioplatense Spanish™, pp. 317-327), Francisco Ocampo deals with Rioplatense Spanish in which there are prepositional phrases without the prepositions as exemplified in (4).

Argentina. The author hypothesizes that ﬁThe deletion of the preposition in casual speech . . gives rise to the question of how the hearer is able to establish the relationship between noun phrase and the verb, or between two noun phrases in the absence of the preposition. There are three factors which are instmmental for the hearer to establish this relation: (i) syntactic: the presence of a parallel structure, (ii) conversational, and (iii) processes of gram- maticalization.ﬂ (p. 3 19) In the penultimate chapter (‚The inversion construction in interrogatives in Span- ish and Catalan™, pp. 329-350), Francisco Ordoiiez addresses structures in Spanish and Catalan such as those in (5) and (6) in which there is an obligatory subject-verb inversion in the interrogative forms (p. 329).

Who Joan sees The author conchrdes that ﬁIt has been shown that movement of the verb in Spanish and Catalan in overt syntax conflicts in impor- tant ways with antisymmetry theory ]Kayne, 19941 and its implications for the landing sites of clitics. The difference between Catalan and Spanish with respect to the Germanic languages examined here in this respect can only be unde~t~d if the former languages lack overt V-to-C. It has also been shown that post-verbal subjects in interrogatives are not in Spec of IP. These post-verbal subjects in interroga- tives behave like post-verbal subjects in the so-called free inversion construction.ﬂ (p. 345) In the eighteenth, and final chapter, of this anthology (‚Scalar effects in Italian metaphony™, pp. 35 l-366), Sylvia Zetterstrand states that ﬁThis paper considers metaphonic data from Italian in the light of three current models of vowel height: the Dependency and Comptementarity Model [Goad, 1991, 19931, the Hierarchical Model [Clement% 19911 and the Incremental Construction Model ([Parkinson, 19951. Each of these models has largely evolved in response to the Articulatory Model [Sagey, 1986; Halle. 19951;ﬂ (p. 351) The author bases her analyses on data from Maiden (1991). Ultimately, Zetterstrand concludes that ﬁCalabrese™s analysis, which is based on the Articulatory Model™s feature geometry, provides the best account of all the factsﬂ (p. 364). She points out that Calabrese™s (1988, 1996) analysis is the only one which meets her three criteria of adequacy because ﬁ(a) It describes all outputs as a single process (b) It explains why only e o are fully assimilated (c) It accounts for the height hierarchyﬂ (p. 364). 232 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 225-234 Editors Lema and Treviiio have produced the proceedings of LSRL XXVI in a timely fashion. Moreover, their editorial work is excellent. An ‚Index of authors™ (pp. 367-372), an ‚Index of terms and concepts (pp. 373-377), and an ‚Index of lan- guages and language families™ (pp. 378-379) complement this volume. Those with a professional academic commitment to Romance linguistics should make a point to include all of the LSRL volumes in their personal libraries because each volume contains state-of-the-art essays of established and emerging scholars in the Romance languages. Moreover, every new volume features what is usually the most current theoretical linguistic approaches. To be sure, every volume belongs in the libraries of all serious academic institutions.
