The University of California at Irvine was the site of the 27th annual Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (henceforth LSRL), February 20-22, 1997. The present volume contains the selected proceedings of that conference. In their brief prefatory statement, editors Schwegler, Tranel and Uribe-Etxebarria extended their appreciation ﬁto the authors of the 150 abstracts that were submitted for the confer- ence, to the 80 reviewers from all over the world who contributed their time and expertise to help us narrow down the field to the 38 papers (and 4 alternates) that were selected for the symposium, and to the participants themselves, including our four keynote speakers, Carmen Silva-Corvalan, Juan Uriagereka, Luigi Burzio, and Viviane DCprez (the latter two did not submit a manuscript for these proceedings)ﬂ (p. vi). The 22 published papers included in this collection feature 13 papers on Spanish (an unusually high number), 6 on French, 2 on Italian, and 1 on Portuguese. More- over, the various studies included 17 syntactic studies, 4 phonological studies, and 1 which deals with syntax/morphology (chapter 8). Once again, the studies in this annual showcase of the best work in Romance linguistics provide a mix of estab- lished and emerging scholars from the U.S. and Europe (The United Kingdom, Switzerland, The Netherlands). Chapter 1 (‚On null objects in Old French™, pp. l-l 1) by Deborah Arteaga pre- sents four arguments that the null object in Old French was a pro and not a null vari- able: ﬁ(i) the empty category appears in left-dislocation structures where there is another Wh-element in COMP, (ii) the null object is found in certain adjunct clauses, (iii) the reference of the null object is invariably taken from a preceding NP in con- joined sentences, and (iv), where relevant, the null object triggers past participle agreementﬂ (p. 5). She concludes her paper by noting that ﬁ[w]e have argued that 0024.3841/00/$ - see front matter 0 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. PII: SOO24-3841(99)00025-X 60 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 5947 Old French data support the notion that the null object pro is licensed by strong nominal features of AgrO (as proposed by Bianchi and Figuereido Silva, 1994, and SalomC and Maruenda, 1995), but not necessarily by the feature ‚strong [+person]ﬁ™ (P. 9). In the second chapter (‚Spanish codas and overapplication™, pp. 13-23), Eric Bakovic re-analyzes certain facts of Spanish phonology within the framework of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993; see also Benua, 1997), i.e., in terms of input-output (IO-) Faithfulness, output-output (00-) Identity, and coda- condition constraints. The author examines the phonological phenomena of Nasal Depalatalization (Harris, 1983: 52-55; Hualde, 1989; Pensado Ruiz, 1997) and Aspiration (Harris, 1983: 45-47; Hualde, 1989, 1991) within the framework of Optimality Theory. Bakovic introduces the notion of Transderivational Correspon- dence Theory (Benua, 1997) as a means by which ﬁ. . . inputs are related to their out- puts by input-output (IO-) Correspondence (regulated by IO-Faithf™fulness) con- straints), and outputs are related to particular morphologically-related outputs by output-output (00-) Correspondence (regulated by 00-Zdent(ity) constraintsﬂ (p. 15). Bakovic concludes his analysis with a discussion of neutralization and allo- phonic processes as related to the data in his paper. In the next chapter (‚Verb movement and its effects on determinerless plural sub- jects™, pp. 25-40) Elena E. Benedict0 studies ﬁ. . . the distribution and interpretation of determinerless (plural) subjects (DS)ﬂ (p. 25). She then shows that ﬁ. . . there is indeed a correlation between their syntactic position and their interpretation, as works like Diesing™s (1992) suggest, but that a larger generalization is missed which arises from languages with the syntactic behavior of Spanishﬂ (p. 25). In the fourth chapter (‚Expletive auxiliaries™, pp. 41-51), Gerhard Brugger observes that: ﬁThe present perfect (PrP) in English differs from the PrP in languages like Italian (and French, German, Dutch, etc.) in a number of properties. A well known difference is that, as illustrated in (l), only in lan- guages like Italian can the PrP be modified by temporal specifications that denote definite intervals in the past such as yesterday, last week, or in 1944. (la) (*Last week) Cadu has made Caipirinha. (1 b) La settimana scorsa Cadu ha fatto Caipirinha.ﬂ (p, 41). The author poses two questions, namely, ﬁ(a) Why is the English PrP subject to the Past Adverb Constraint? And (b) in what way precisely is the PrP in languages like Italian different so that it is compatible with past-time adverbsﬂ (p. 41)? In the following chapter (‚On the structure of declarative clauses™, pp. 53-66), Ricardo Echepare examines declarative sentences in Spanish within the framework of Jackendoff™s (1972: 56-58) speaker-oriented adverbs such as frankly,fortunately, and so forth. Specifically, the author demonstrates that there are syntactico-semantic restrictions in Spanish with a colloquial construction with the expression la verdad ‚frankly™ (p. 58). These constructions are exemplified in (2) and (3). (2) La verdad es que estoy cansado. ‚the truth is that I am tired™ (p. 58) Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 5947 61 (3) Estoy cansado, la verdad. ‚frankly, I am tired™ (p. 59) Chapter 6 (‚N/A of a N DP™s: Predicate raising and subject licensing™, pp. 67-80) by Manuel Espaiiol-Echevarria deals with N/A of a N DP constructions in Spanish shown in (4). (4) La bestia de1 doctor ‚the beast of-the doctor™ ‚the beast of a doctor™ (p. 67) After a careful analysis of these syntagms, Espaiiol-Echevarria concludes that ﬁ. . . N/A of a N DP™s involve in essence a sentential structure complement of a D-head (Kayne, 1994)ﬂ (p. 79). The seventh chapter (‚Thetic and categorical, attributive and referential: Towards an explanation of definiteness effects™, pp. 81-95) by Thierry Etchegoyhen and George Tsoulas deals with definiteness. The French DP constructions examined are definite DPs modified in a restrictive relative clause (5), and definite DPs in superla- tive constructions (6). (5) II est venu la femme que j™attendais. ‚it is arrived the women that I was expecting™ (p. 83) (6) I1 est mort le plus petit pompier du monde. ‚it is died the shortest fireman in the world™ (p. 83) Etchegoyhen and Tsoulas conclude that ﬁ. . . we have brought to light a number of important data concerning the distribution of indefinites in impersonal constructions. These data clearly show that the definiteness effect cannot be explained in terms of local constraints. We argued that these represent thetic judgmentsﬂ (p. 93). In the next chapter (‚Negation and independent morphological development™, pp. 97-l 10) by John Grinstead deals with the acquisition of negation in child Catalan. The data base used in this study derives from the Serra and Sole corpus of the CHILDES data base (MacWhinney and Snow, 1985). The author employed theories of child language development found in Pierce (1989), and Borer and Wexler (1987). Moreover, the theories of negation of Laka (1990, 1993), Zanuttini (1991, 1996) and River0 and Terzi (1995) were used. Chapter 9 (‚Enclitic -n in Spanish™, pp. 111-127) by James Harris deals with con- structions such as those in (7). (7a) P&en-me-lo (standard) (7b) P he-men-lo (‚intrusion™) (7c) P&en-men-lo (‚iteration™) (7d) P&en-me-lon (7e) P&en-men-ion ‚pass it to me™ (p. 111) 62 Book review i Lingua 110 (2000) 59-67 Harris assumes the theoretical framework of Distributed Morphology (Calabrese, 1994; Halle and Marantz, 1993, 1994) which adopts much, but not all of Chomsky™s (1995) Minimalist Program. The tenth chapter (‚Je wux que park Paul: A neglected construction™, pp. 129- 141) by Brigitte Kampers-Manhe deals with the phenomenon of French Stylistic Inversion which are constructions with a postverbal subject, In general, studies have dealt with this postposition of subject in interrogative structures such as (8), in rela- tive clauses such as (9), and in subjunctive clauses such a (10). (8) Quand est parti Paul? ‚when has Paul left™ (p. 129) (9) La femme de qui r&e souvent Paul est ma&e. ‚the woman Paul often dreams about is married™ (p. 129) (10) Je veux que parte Paul. ‚I want Paul to leave™ (p. 129) The author provides an analysis of sentences like (10) above with postverbal sub- jects in subjunctive clauses within a Minimalist framework (Chomsky, 1995). In chapter 11 (‚Mood phrase, case checking and obviation™, pp. 143-154), Paula Kempchinsky discusses the three phenomena noted in the title of her essay and she notes that: ﬁThe essence of this anaIysis is as follows. Subjunctive complements to certain matrix predicates do not project a CP level, but rather only MP (Mood Phrase). The subjunctive subject has its nominative Case checked by T, but this Case checking must ultimately be licensed by a Co node (Koizumi, 1995; Watan- abe, 1993). Hence the binding domain of the subject will be defined as the CP in which its nominative Case checking is licensed. The possibility of a higher Co licensing the Case checking power of a lower T will be argued to arise from the temporal dependency between the two clauses.ﬂ (p. 144) The following chapter (‚Syllable structure and sonority sequencing: Evidence from Emilian™, pp. 155-170) by Michele Loporcaro deals with ﬁ[t]he role of the sonority hierarchy in determining the organization of segments into syllables [Ohala and Kawasaki, 1984; Clements, 1990; Dogil and Luschiitzky, 19901ﬂ (p. 155). The specific question which Loporcaro addresses is the following: ﬁ ‚[I]s the Sonority Sequencing Generalization an absolute constraint on representations, or simply a preference condition expressing universal markedness values? ™ (Blevins, 1995: 210-211)ﬂ (p. 155). Loporcaro argues in favor of Blevins™ (1995 : 210-2 11) approach, and he provides data from Italo-Romance dialects rich in consonant clusters such as Emilia-Romagna dialect of Bolognese (Coca, 1970). The author provides evidence for his proposal from French re-syllabification (Laeufer, 1991) and from Grizzanese, an Italo- Romance dialect spoken some 40 kilometers north of Bologna (Loporcaro, 1991). In chapter 13 (‚Condition on feature specification and negative lexicalization in Spanish™, pp. 171-181) by Enrique MallCn, the author points out that ﬁSpanish may be classified as a negative agreement or negative concord language where a prever- bal surface negator and a postverbal negative element may cooccurﬂ (p. 171). Mal- Book review I Lingua I10 (2000) 5947 63 1Cn demonstrates this syntactico-semantic feature in Spanish with the example in (II). (11) Picasso *(no) fotografib (iambs) a nadie. ‚Picasso never photographed anyone™ (p. 17 1) In the remainder of this study, the author addresses Negative Polarity Items (Bosque, 1980; see also Suiier, 1995; Uribe-Etxebarria, 1994; Zanuttini, 1991). These constructions are indeed syntactically and semantically complex, and for this reason they provide intriguing challenges to grammatical theory. In the fourteenth chapter (‚Vestigial trochees in Oiil dialects™, pp. 183-195) Jean- Pierre Montreuil ﬁexamines vestigial traces of trochees in dialects of the northern half of France and focuses on the distributional phenomena which characterize the right edge of wordsﬂ (p. 183). In this study, Montreuil offers evidence for a vestigial trochee based on evidence gleaned from Oil dialects. He ultimately claims that he has ﬁ. . . attempted to document cases where trochees can be posited to account for some word-final phenomena, even though the weak member of the trochee is not itself manifestedﬂ (p. 194). The next chapter (‚Definite/zero alternations in Portuguese: Towards a unification of topic constructions™, pp. 197-212) by Eduardo Raposo deals with the fact that ﬁPortuguese is the only (major) Romance language with ‚English-style topicaliza- tion™ of a direct object, i.e. with the clause-internal site where the topic is construed contains a gap, annotated in [12] as ec [Chomsky, 1977; Duarte, 1987; Martins, 19941ﬂ (p. 197). The author then offers a parametric account of this syntactic phe- nomenon. (12a) Esse livro, o Luis comprou ec para a Maria. (Portuguese) (12b) ﬁEse livro, Luis ha comprado ec para Maria. (Spanish) (12~) *Ce livre, Louis a achete™ ec pour Marie. (French) ‚that book, (the) Louis bought ec for Maria™ (p. 197) Chapter 16 (‚On object-clitic placement in Italian child language™, pp. 213-224) by Jeannette Schaeffer is a ﬁreport on the results of an experimental study of the acquisition of object clitic placement in Italianﬂ (p. 213). The author™s working hypothesis is an extension of one proposed by Hyams (1996) and stated in (13). (13) Developmental hypothesis Specificity is not always grammatically marked in the grammar of 2-year old children. (p. 213) After showing the pattern for object-clitic placement in the Italian of adults, Scha- effer provides samples of data from Italian child language from her own research project. According to the author, ﬁ2-year old Italian children optionally mark speci- ficity, resulting in optional object clitic placement, but that at the age of 3 children are roughly adult-like in this respectﬂ (p. 223). 64 Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 59-67 In chapter 17 (‚On borrowing as a mechanism of syntactic change™, pp. 22%246), Carmen Silva-Corvalan, one of the keynote speakers for LSRL XXVII, presents evi- dence to support the view, i.e. ﬁthat the transfer of features from one language to another is not a matter of unconstrained behavior or changeﬂ (p. 225). The author™s own previous research (Silva-Corvahin, 1993, 1994a,b) has dealt with these same issues. The eighteenth chapter (‚Subject positions and the roles of CP™, pp. 247-270) by Luis Silva-Villar deals with data from the Northwestern Iberian Languages including Galician, Leonese together with its major dialects of Asturian Bables in Spain and Mirandese in Portugal as well as Portuguese and Spanish and special reference to Dominican Spanish and its Cibaefio dialect (p. 247, note 2). The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that ﬁ. . . specific NPs can co-appear with expletive subjects in pro-drop languages, supporting the independent checking of the E[xtended] P[rojection] P[rinciple] feature of the Case-assigning feature of T[ense]. Addition- ally, I also offer theoretical arguments that certain well-known word-order phenom- ena of some Romance languages are attributable to a single parameter: the overt licensing of the Multiple Spec Configuration . . . ﬂ (pp. 247-248). Silva-Villar notes that ﬁ[a] consequence of [his] analysis is that the status of null-subject languages with expletives must be re-examinedﬂ (p. 248). Chapter 19 (‚Licensing DP-internal predication™, pp. 27 l-282) by Petra Sleeman and Els Verheugd is concerned with Kayne™s (1994) antisymmetry theory. In partic- ular, the authors ﬁ. . . argue that simple adjectives within DP, i.e., adjectives without any complement or modifier, cannot be analyzed as D-structure predicatesﬂ (p. 271). Sleeman and Verheugd base their arguments on French data but their hypothesis is also applicable to English. The twentieth chapter (‚From being to having: Questions about ontology from a Kayne/Szabolcsi syntax™, pp. 283-306) by Juan Uriagereka, another keynote speaker at the LSRL XXVII, is an intriguing philosophical study about structures that indi- cate possession (Kayne, 1994; Szabolcsi, 1983). In this essay, Uriagereka examines the various manifestations of possessive constructions with the verbs have and be, and he concludes that ﬁthe view that possession is out there in reality, and we code it trivially through little things like have, with, and all the rest, is mistaken. I also think it is wrong to think of possession as the manifestation of a lexical relation that certain terms allow. Possession is a kind of syntax, with well-behaved properties. Correspondingly, the semantics of possession seems to be a kind of presentational operationﬂ (p. 305). The penultimate chapter (‚Pragmatic transfer from less developed to more devel- oped systems: Spanish deictic terms in Barcelona™, pp. 307-317) by Robert E. Vann addresses transference from one Spanish to Catalan (Vann, 1995, 1996, 1997). The author notes that his study provides 3 important contributions to linguistics: ﬁFirst, my analysis provides evidence of transfer between non-parallel structures without gaps or weak- nesses in existing linguistic paradigms; thus, it challenges popular theories [Weinreich, 1968: 4; Silva- Corvalan, 1994b: 1351 of structural constraints on where crosslinguistic transfer can occur. Furthermore, the analysis underscores the permeability of the pragmatic component of the grammar and thus makes a case for linguistic motivations for pragmatic transfer in a language-contact situation. Finally, the case Book review I Lingua 110 (2000) 5947 65 study recognizes a unique contact-variety of Spanish in which pragmatic transfer may be characteristic.ﬂ (p. 309) The last chapter of this selected proceedings volume (‚Object shift in Old French™, pp. 319-332) by Laurie Zaring addresses the processes of object shift in Old French. The author points out that ﬁ[tlhe phenomenon of Object Shift (OS) in the Germanic languages has provided substantial support for syntactic movement driven by mor- phological feature-checking, for configurational properties of clause-level functional categories, and for word order variation produced by their interactionﬂ (p. 319). In particular, Zaring examines the Old French and Middle French neuter pronoun cr ‚it™, and she concludes that this form is an example of Object Shift (p. 330). An extremely useful set of indices (author index, pp. 333-336; language index, pp. 337-339; and subject index, pp. 340-349) complement this collection of excel- lent papers on the Romance languages. Editors Schwegler, Tranel, and Uribe-Etxe- barria deserve praise for compiling the selected proceedings of LSRL XXVII in a timely fashion. They have produced a worthwhile collection of state-of-the-art research in Romance linguistics from the premier North American conference on the Romance languages. References Benua, Laura, 1997.
