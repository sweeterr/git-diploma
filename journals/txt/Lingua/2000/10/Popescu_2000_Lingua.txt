ELSEVIER Lingua I10 (2000) 773-799 www.elsevier.nl/locate/lingua The morphophonology of the Romanian clitic sequence* Alexandra Popescu* Seminar,fiir Allgemeine Sprachwissenschgji, Heinrich-Heine-Universitiit Diisseldod UniversitiitsstraJe 1, 40225 Diisseldofl, Germany Received 28 February 2000; revised version 31 March 2000 Abstract This paper proposes an analysis of some morphophonological phenomena of Romanian pronominal clitics which have been treated so far as idiosyncrasies. I argue that pronominal clitics have only one underlying form and that surface forms are different because of the dif- ferent environments in which they appear and because of their morphological properties.

Depending on the context in which they appear, they display at the least two and four different forms. The main subject of this paper is to explain this distribution, departing from the idea that the different forms are not real allomorphs, but rather context dependent realisations of the same morphemes. * I would like to thank Ana Maria Barb& Emanuela Canclini, Birgit Gerlach, Janet Grijzenhout, Wolfgang Kehrein, Martin Kriimer, Albert Ortmann and Dieter Wunderlich for many helpful comments. * Phone: +49 21 l/81-15123; E-mail: popescu@phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de 037%2166/00/$ - see front matter 0 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 I give a short description of the Romanian vowel system including glides, in so far as it is necessary for the under- standing of the clitic forms. In Section 3 I show in detail how the different forms of the pronominal clitics are distributed. The distribution of the clitical forms widely depends on the presence of other clitics. Therefore, before explaining how these forms are distributed, I will discuss the morphological status of the clitics and of the unit formed by the clitics in the light of the framework of Minimalist Morphology (Wunderlich and Fabri, 1995) (Section 4). In Section 5 I will present an analysis of the distribution of clitical forms in the framework of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993; McCarthy and Prince, 1995). Section 6 concludes. 2. The Romanian vowel system Before describing the forms of the obj-clitics™ let me briefly sketch the Romanian vowel system, as it is indispensable for the further development of this paper. The vowel phonemes of Romanian are presented in (1). Romanian has two cen- tral vowels that have the status of phonemes, namely /a/ and /i/. (1) Romanian vowels +front +back +high i i U e a 0 +low a Moreover, Romanian has four glides: j, w, p, e, which can be combined with full vowels in a large number of diphthongs given in (2). j and w can also be realised as [j] and [ﬁI when they are placed at the end of the word in a coda position after a con- sonant. According to Vasiliu (1965) and Limba Romdnri (1956) the diphthong inven- tary consists of the following (simplified): (2) a. Diphthongs: ea, ja, qa, $0, ej, iw, ow, uj, aw, ij, uw b. Triphthongs: epa, j9a, eaw, eaj, jaw, jaj, jej, 9aj The status of glides in Romanian has been a matter of debate among phonologists. Some analyse them as separate phonemes (Avram (1991) among others), others (for example Vasiliu, 1965, 1985) as allophones of the full vowels. Chitoran (1997) analyses j and w as glides which are allophones to the full vowels i and U, and ea, ,oa as low vowels, arising from the lowering of mid vowels under stress. I adopt the analysis of Vasiliu (1985) and consider the glides p and e as well as the glides j and w to be allophones of the corresponding full vowels. There is how- ™ I will refer to pronominal clitics in this article as ‚obj-clitics™ (from ‚object-clitics™), since there are no subject-clitics in Romanian. If necessary, I will specify whether they are direct object clitics (dobj- clitics) or indirect object clitics (iobj-clitics). A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 115 ever a difference between these glides: ,e and p, in contrast to j and W, do not occupy an onset position but are part of the nucleus (for evidence see Chitoran, 1997). 3. Forms and distribution of the clitics In this section I will first present the surface forms of the obj-clitics and then describe their distribution. 3.1. Forms of the clitics As shown in table 1, all Romanian pronominal clitics appear in two or three dif- ferent forms.* In each cell of Table 1 both the orthographical form and the respective pronunciation(s) are rendered. Table I Forms of the obj-clitics Singular - Accusative Dative Plural Accusative Dative I ma [ma] imi [imJ] ne [ne] ni [nil, ne [ne] m [ml mi [mil. [mjl, [m™l ne [nel ni [nj], ne [ne] 2 te [te] iii [its™] va [va] va [va]. vi [vi] te [tel ii [tsi], [tsj], [tsJ] v [VI v [VI, vi [vjl 3m PI [ill ii [iJ] 1 Ul ii [$I i [ijl, til le [le], Ii [Ii] 3f o LOI i bjl, L.il le [le] le Uel le [Is], Ii [lj] 3 refl se [se] s [s] isi [iJ1] gi Uil, LPI se [se] s [s] The variations observed can be summarised as follows. First, some clitics exhibit an alternation between a full vowel (e and i) and a glide (_e and j), for example the 2nd Singular Accusative clitic (e.g. te / tg). Second, some clitics show an alternation between vowel (I or a) and no vowel, as for example in the 1st Singular Dative clitic (im™ / mi) and in the 1st Singular Accusative clitic (ma / m). Third, some clitics have allomorphs with e as well as allomorphs with i, as for example the 1st Plural Dative clitic (e.g. ne / ne). The question then arises how these alternations are triggered. At a closer look at their distribution, one observes that the phonetically reduced forms appear usually when more than one clitic is present. Not only the combination 2 The phonetic realisations of the Romanian graphemes with diacritics are: 5 = [a], i = [il. 8 = m, I= [ts]. In the following I will use the orthographical variant in the examples, except in square brackets [ ] where I will use the phonetic transcription. 116 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 of obj-clitics, but also the combination of obj-clitics and auxiliary clitics governs the appearance of the reduced forms. The forms of the most frequent auxiliary clitics are shown in Table 2.3 Table 2 Forms of the Auxiliaries (aux-clitics) Singular Plural 1 2 3 1 2 3 Perfect Future Conditional am [am] oi [oj] a$ [aSI ai [aj] oi [oj] ai [aj] a [al o [ol ar [ar] am [am] om [om] am [am] ati [a&J] ot:™ [OW] ap [atsj] au [awl or [or] ar [ar] There are also other particles that appear in the Romanian VP, but none of them can be analysed as special clitics: they are either simple clitics or have affix sta- tus (for a detailed analysis of all these elements see Barbu, 1998). I will concen- trate in the following only on combinations of special clitics, i.e.: of obj- and aux- clitics. Anticipating the analyis, I claim that the overt realisation of the clitics depends on the clitic combination: because the unit consisting of all clitics tends to have a min- imal number of syllables, some of the clitics are reduced. Therefore in the next sec- tion I am going to look at the combinations in detail and compare the forms that show up in combination with other clitics with the forms that show up when the clitic appears without other clitics. 3.2. Alternation conditions for the obj-clitics One of the alternations concerns the one between vowels and glides. In (3a), the 1st Plural Dative clitic surfaces with the glide ,e, while in (3b) the clitic surfaces as ne (with a full vowel). (3) e 1 B a. Oblinator?, reduction b.

In (3~) we can see that the presence of a vowel in the following syllable is not a sufficient con- dition for the obligatory reduction to a glide. The reduction is only optional and I have omitted the Perfect variants of some forms which involve an additional auxiliary,8 (‚be™).

ODtional reduction [ne.] aducem. /[ne] a.ducem ~PL.D bring. IPL ‚We bring for us.™ As can be seen, the reduction is obligatory only in cases where the full forms of the clitics would project more than one syllable. This variation type applies to the clitics ne (lPL.ACC), te (2SG~cc) and le (~PL.F.ACC, 3PL.D) (see table (1)).5 The same variation is observed for the alternation between the vowel i and the glide j in (4). The vowel is obligatorily reduced to a glide before another clitic begin- ning with a vowel6 (4) ilj a.

This type of alternation applies to the clitics Iﬂi (3SG.D, 3PL.M.ACC), @ (2SG.D), imi (IsG.D), ni (IPL.D), vi (~PL.D), li (~PL.D) (see Table 1). These two vowels, i and e, have glide allophones in the phonological system of Romanian. The same holds for o: in Romanian there is a glide 4 (see Section 2). However, in the obj-clitics, this vowel cannot be reduced to a glide. The 3.SG.F.ACC clitic consists only of this vowel and cannot be reduced when it is adjacent to ™ Moreover, the reduction of the clitic before a full verb is also subject to further restrictions: it nor- mally takes place only if the initial vowel of the verb is u or D and it is very marked for other initial vow- els. For example, for the verb opri ‚to stop™, the pronunciation [ne o.prim] is at the limit of acceptabil- ity. I have no explanation until now for this difference between u, o on the one side and e, a on the other side. 5 In only one case, e is not reduced to e but skipped: with the reflexive clitic se. This exception can be explained by the fact that this is a case of real allomorphy: s is the reduction of the older form of the reflexive pronoun, SJ (see Avram, 1986). I assume the existence of a form of the reflexive accusative, /sa/, that appears only in combinations with other clitics. 6 I ignore optional reduction before of i a full verb beginning with a vowel because of the interaction between reduction of i and deletion of i. which is involved there. 778 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 another vowel to form a diphthong. Instead, the clitic o encliticises in spite of the proclitic context (i.e.: the indicative mode - see the regular position in (5)) - as can be seen in (6). By comparing (6a) with (6b) and (6~) it can be observed that the spe- cial position of the clitic o cannot be interpreted as a morphologically driven phe- nomenon. The masculine singular and the feminine plural remain in the expected position, i.e. before the auxiliary clitic. (5) 3SG.F 0 in indicative (regular position) a.

A fact that seems to make the condi- tions for the position of o more complicated is that not only the sequence with the reduced vowel [le. o am.] is ungrammatical, but also the variant where the clitic o would be realised as a full vowel, [le o. am].

The vowels t™ and a are not reduced, but deleted in order to minimise the number of syllables. These are exactly the vowels which cannot be reduced to glides. Remember that these two vowels are phonemes in Romanian.™ ™ Initial [ i] is best analysed as an epenthetic vowel which fills a nucleus. I base this analysis on Lom- bard (1976) and Avram (1991). Following Avram, initial i appears only before m and n (and in clitics also before ts). In all words which contain initial i, either this vowel can be left out or the nasal conso- nant can be realised as a syllabic segment. For these reasons I assume that initial i is only one of the pos- sible ways to fill a mora. The phonological representation of the clitic il(3sgmAcc) would be / pl/. This analysis matches with the evolution of words beginning with i (see Lombard, 1976): This vowel (‚prothetical i™) was added to the clitic pronouns in order to make possible the enclitisation on words ending on consonants, after the historical loss of the final -U in the 16th century. The pronominal clitics were only enclitics then. A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000, 773-799 779 In (8), the initial vowels i (8a) and a (8b) are obligatorily deleted: the two clitics project one single syllable. As can be seen in (9a-b), the deletion is not obligatory if the clitic immediately precedes the verb instead of preceding another clitic. (8) a. (9) a.

In contrast to the proclitical position, i is forbidden here. (10) Obliaator?, deletion of i enclitically a.

In order to preserve this informa- tion, the clitics may project more than one syllable. In (12), the monosyllabic reduced form [mill is not allowed in this context, because the morphological infor- mation of the auxiliary a would be skipped. * The position of the clitics is not prosodically triggered, but morphologically. It is the morphological category of the verb that determines the position of the clitic before or after it: clitics occur after the verb in imperative and gerundive mode, and before it in all other cases. In the following section I will show this in more detail. 780 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 (12) [mi.

In Table 3 and 4 below, all clitic combinations are presented for illustration. The cells containing a star are impossible combinations (I will not go into the reasons of these gaps; I will shortly refer to this problem again in the following section). For the aux-obj combinations I have chosen only the Per- fect auxiliary to illustrate the possible syllable structure, since the combinations with the other auxiliaries are similar. The light shaded cells contain clitics with a deleted vowel, the darker shaded cells contain clitics with a reduced vowel, and finally the darkest shaded cells contain clitics exhibiting both deletion and reduction. I have abstracted away from the optional syllabification with the stem. For reasons of space I restrain the combinations to sequences of two clitics (obj-obj and obj-aux combi- nations).

Until now I have said nothing about the variation of the first and second Person plural dative clitic (see Table 1) between i and e. As can be seen from Table 3, the form with e (the same as the accusative form) appears only when the clitic is realised without another obj-clitic (see (13a)), and the form with i appears when the clitic appears together with an accusative clitic (see (13b)).

Popescu 1 Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 781 Combinations between an obj-clitic and an aux-clitic (Perf) / PI This variation depends on the combination with other clitics as well. However, its status is different from the other variation types. The clitic has the form n< (ne with a glide, for reasons shown above) if it appears with an auxiliary clitic, see (14). Thus the variation in (13), between ne and ni, has nothing to do with syllable structure. (14) [ne a.1 adus 2PL.D 3SG.PERF bringPART ‚He brought us.™ This alternation is neither purely phonologically determined, as one can see by the contrast between (13) and (15): in (15), the clitic preceding a verb beginning with 1 like the clitic in (13) has the form ne, not ni.

Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 the accusative. See Gerlach (1998) for an analysis of similar cases in other Romance languages. In the next two sections I will propose an analysis of this distribution, based on Minimalist Morphology (Wunderlich and Fabri, 1995), a lexical early insertion mor- phological theory, and on Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky, 1993 and McCarthy and Prince 1995). I will show that this distribution is better explained as a result of the evaluation of output candidates by both prosodic and morphological constraints. 4. Clitics are clitics Before presenting my proposal of an OT-analysis of these facts, I will try to clar- ify the morphological status of clitics. In the following I will look in more detail at the status of obj-clitics and aux-clitics in order to make clear that they have to be analysed as clitics rather than as affixes. According to Zwicky (1977), one can distinguish between simple and special cli- tics. Simple clitics are reduced variants of syntactically free elements. They are phonologically conditioned allomorphs, in particular they are driven by reduction in fast speech. Special clitics are lexical allomorphs which have another syntactic dis- tribution than their non-clitic counterparts. In two recent analyses, it has been argued that obj-clitics are affixes, while aux- clitics are either words (Monachesi, 1998) or affixes (Barbu, 1998). On the basis of Zwicky and Pullum™s (1983) criteria for affixes, these authors try to prove that there is no difference between obj-clitics (and, in the case of Barbu, also aux-clitics) and affixes. I will first briefly discuss the arguments that these authors put forward for the affixal status of obj-clitics, then for the affixal status of aux-clitics. Finally, I will argue for their clitic status. Barbu (1998) claims an affix status of obj-clitics on the basis of the following observations inspired by Zwicky and Pullum™s (1983) criteria for affixes vs. clitics: they exhibit a rigid order, they have a limited distribution (a high selection degree with respect to the host); there are arbitrary gaps in the paradigm (morphological idiosyncrasies), repetition in co-ordination, possibility of clitic doubling, impossibil- ity for the clitics to be analysed as constituents. Note that Zwicky and Pullum (1983) understood their criteria as not being neces- sary, but as forming a continuum scale. An entity is considered to have more or less clitic or affix status depending on its location on the affix-clitic scale. So in deciding the status of an entity one has in some ambiguous cases to decide which criteria are sufficient to assume the clitic or affixal status. Additionally, one may use other cri- teria in order to hold this decision. For entities that fulfil only a part of the criteria (which are in the middle of the scale) one must be able to find an appropriate repre- sentation for this entity. With these preliminaries, I claim that not all of the arguments brought by Barbu (1998) and Monachesi (1998) contradict the clitic status of the Romanian obj-clitics. A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 783 Special clitics can have a high selection degree for their host as well; from the phe- nomenon of clitic doubling analysed as agreement does not follow that the clitics analysed as agreement markers are bound elements. As for the idiosyncrasies, I show in the following that variations can be explained by regular changes. Moreover, I argue that the variations can be better explained if we assume that the obj-clitics are clitics. Concerning auxiliaries there are more positions in the recent literature: Dobrovie- Sorin (1995) analyses them as clitics, Monachesi (1998) as words, Barbu (1998) as affixes. Dobrovie-Sorin analyses the clitic cluster in the framework of the Minimalist Pro- gram. She proposes an analysis of the position of clitics in the cluster, but, as the dis- tinction between clitic and affix is not of interest for her, I will not discuss this analysis here. Monachesi™s (1998) analysis of auxiliaries as words does not look closely at their phonological properties. She analyses them as words because she assumes them to be the hosts for the obj-clitics (which have affixal status in her analysis). However, auxiliaries cannot be full words, because they do not bear accent and they are syl- labified in the phonological word they belong to. They must at least be simple cli- tics. In contrast to Monachesi (1998), Barbu (1998) analyses the aux-clitics as affixes using the Zwicky and Pullum (1983) criteria as in the case of the obj-clitics. In the following I show that there is counter-evidence for the affix-status of aux- clitics as well as for the affix-status of aux-clitics. The two types of clitics have some properties that are clearly not affixal. I will briefly enumerate and discuss these prop- erties. First, obj-clitics and aux-clitics have more than one possible position. The position of obj-clitics depends on the mood of the verb: they occur in front of the verb in most moods and tenses (see (16a)) but after it in the imperative and the gerund (see ( 16b,c)). (16) Obj-clitics In front qf the verb (proclitic): default a. [ill m&&c 3SG.M.ACC eat. 1s~ ‚I eat it™ After the verb (enclitic): in Imperative and Gerund b. Imperative c. Gerund manrinc-g- [I] ! m2ncCndu9- [I] eat-IMP 3SG.M.ACC eat-GER %G.M.ACC ‚eat it! ™ ‚eating it™ As for aux-clitics, their unmarked position is before the verb (see (17a)), but in old (literary) speech the auxiliary can occur after the verb (see (17b)). A semi- 9 [u] is in fact only a residue of an old termination and it appears only when obj-clitics beginning with a consonant follow. 784 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 productive enclitic position of the aux-clitics are the swearing and affection-phrases (see (17~)). (17) Au-clitics In front qf the verb (proclitic): default a. L- ar manta %G.M.ACC %G.COND eat.INF ‚He would eat it™ After the verb (enclitic): b. Old (literary (old or ironical) c. Affection-phrases M&at- ai? MInca l- ar mama! eat.PART ~SG.PERF eat.INF %G.M.ACC 3SG.COND mama ‚Did you eat? ™ ‚He is sweet! ‚(Lit. : ‚Mama would eat him™) The existence of these two possibilities of placement contradicts one of the criteria for affixes, i.e. that the direction of affixation must remain stable. This criterion goes back to Klavans (1985), and it is also a consequence of Zwicky™s criterion of ‚strict ordering™: the affix and the stem must be strictly ordered with respect to each other. So affixes should have a fixed position (they should be suffixes or prefixes), while clitics need not.‚O A second argument against the affixal status of clitics is the fact that obj-clitics and aux-clitics can optionally cliticise to a phonological word to which they do not belong syntactically. This is why in example (18a) and (18b) the clitic is reduced and integrated into the last syllable of the preceding word. In (18b), the last vowel of the host is realised as a glide and the full vowel of the clitic fills the rhyme position. (18) a. Obj-clitics b. Aux-clitics [ma.ma 1.1, place [tJi.ne ar.], face asta? mother %G.M.ACC like.3sG who 3SG.COND do.INF this ‚Mother likes him™ ‚Who would do this? ™ In this point Romanian differs from other Romance languages like French, Italian and Spanish, where the clitics always attach to the verbal host (see Spencer, 1991). In contrast to clitics, which can attach phonologically to more than one lexical cat- egory, affixes have a high selection degree for their host (Zwicky, 1977; Zwicky and Pullum, 1983). This means that affixes always belong phonologically to their syn- tactic host but clitics do not have to. Therefore, obj-clitics in Romanian display a property typical for clitics. lo The placing of the pronominal clitics on the right side of some of the verbal forms is usually analysed as a movement of the verb (see for example Dobrovie-Sorin, 1994). I do not discuss this analy- sis here, as it is a theoretical issue, concerning general assumptions about morphology and about the way one deals with affixes. It is of no consequence for the criteria regarding the affix status. I will come to the problem of the placement of clitics (in so far as this issue is relevant for this analysis) in Section 5.1 and 5.2. A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 785 Third, clitics find their position not only with reference to the verb, but also with reference to other special clitics (see Gerlach (1998) for this criterion). The relative order of the clitics remains unchanged if they occur before or after the verb (compare (19a) with (19b) and (20a) with (20b)). (19) Order of the obj-clitics a.

If dobj-clitics had to occur in first position adjacent to the stem, they would also occur adjacent to the stem in Imperative and Gerund when they are placed after the verb. Thus, the order dobj-iobj would have to be inversed after the verb. ‚I This phenomenon can be explained better if the clitics are assumed to form a mor- phosyntactic unit by themselves. I assume that special clitics build a morphological and syntactic unit - the clitic sequence (see Gerlach, 1998) - which is the base for prosodic restrictions. The existence of this unit can help to explain the mor- phophonological phenomena described above. There are three arguments in favour of this analysis. First, clitics display a fixed order: iobj-dOobj-aux. The linear order of the clitics remains unchanged regardless whether the clitics occur before or after the verb, as I have shown in (19) and (20). This proves that the clitics are treated syntactically as one unit. Second, ‚Clitic split™ is forbidden. The clitics must occur together, they cannot be separated by any other morpheme. (There is only one exception to this rule, the posi- tion of the clitic o in interaction with auxiliaries, as I have shown in Section 3, exam- ple (o).) Third, there are morphologically determined co-occurrence restrictions for the cli- tics. Some combinations of the pronominal clitics are not allowed (see Farkas and Kazazis, 1980; Gerlach, 1998), as for example 3rd Dative, 1st Accusative (see Table 3 above for all the possible and impossible combinations): ﬂ Of course, if they would have the non-affixal property of occurring before and after the verb, this will be still a problem for analysing them as affixes. 786 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 (21) *[i maI prezint-5 3SG.D ISG.ACC present-3sc ‚He presents me to him.™ Such restrictions are unusual for free words and affixes. In the case of affixes we are only concerned with semantic incompatibility between affixes (for example, femi- nine and masculine, or 3rd and second person) or with phonological and prosodic requirements and portmanteau forms. These restrictions cannot be analysed as lan- guage specific idiosyncrasies as Barbu (1998) and Monachesi (1998) propose, because they are mirrored in other languages, for example Romance languages and Greek (see Farkas and Kazazis, 1980; Gerlach, 1998). They cannot be purely seman- tic, because they do not hold for full pronouns. Therefore, there must be a morpho- logically based explanation for them. If the clitics are analysed as a morphological unit, these properties can easily be analysed as morphological restrictions for this domain. The co-occurrence restrictions result from the fact that there are constraints which hold for the unit formed by the clitics and not for the unit formed by the cli- tics with the stem (see Gerlach (1998) for this analysis of clitic co-occurrence restrictions). The CS is different from the mere prosodic unit ‚phonological word™ or ‚clitic group™ (Nespor and Vogel, 1986). Romanian special clitics form a phonological word with the verb and they belong to it syntactically. However, they change their form and position with respect to other adjacent clitics in a more regular way as with respect to their host, as I have shown in detail in the previous section. I consider this to follow from the fact that special clitics form a morphological unit which is the object of phonological and prosodic as well as morphological constraints.‚* In conclusion, some properties of Romanian obj- and aux-clitics can better be explained if they are assumed to be special clitics and to form a morphosyntactic unit by themselves as if they are analysed as affixes that attach to the stem. 5. An OT-analysis: The optimisation of the sequence 5.1. The morphological status of special clitics In this section I will look at the way these facts can be captured in a lexicon- based, late insertion morphological theory, the Minimalist Morphology (henceforth MM), developed by Wunderlich and Fabri (1995). In MM it is assumed that mor- phological processes take place in the lexicon. Words arrive at the interface to syn- tax fully inflected. Lexical items that must be projected into syntax (as independent I2 1 do not think that these properties allow us to analyse the CS as a prosodic unit. There is consider- able counter-evidence against such an analysis. The most important one is that this category cannot be placed between the other prosodic categories (word and phrase). Some of the problems we have to deal with by admitting the existence of the Clitic Group would also be involved when assuming a prosodic unit ‚Clitic Sequence™. A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 787 words) are assumed to be marked [+max] in the lexicon (see also Stiebels and Wun- derlich, 1994). Entities that must not be projected into the syntax (affixes) are assumed to be marked [+min] in the lexicon. Stems, which can be combined with affixes in the lexicon, are assumed to be underspecified for the features [+min] and [+max]. They are assigned [+max] per default at the interface between morphology and syntax (due to their capacity of projecting a paradigm cell).‚ﬂ I assume special clitics to be also underspecified for [min] and [max]. They are subcategorised for verbs like affixes, I4 but they are not part of the word (they are not [+min]). Special clitics attach to each other and form paradigms of CSs at the inter- face to syntax. These CSs are assigned [+max] per default at the interface between morphology and syntax, in the same way as is assumed for paradigm cells of inflected stems combined with affixes. The CS is a morphosyntactic unit on its own, but it is not built in the lexicon. It is built at the interface to syntax, where units that are underspecified for [min] and [max] (i.e. which are not specified like affixes for [+min] and neither are free units [+max]), come together. The CS is generated by the interaction of some constraints and by the underspecification of the clitics and it is subject to a number of morpho- logical and phonological constraints. Is This means that it is not a morphological unit in the same way as the lexical word (formed by affixes and stems). However, when the paradigm of CSs is formed, it behaves in many ways like other morphological units. The evaluation of special clitics and of verbal stems with affixes takes place at the interface of the lexicon and the syntax.lh Prosodically, special clitics are underspecified for syllable and foot structure (stress). This implies that they have to be integrated into an adjacent phonological word. This issue leads us to the problem of placement. Pronominal and auxiliary clitics are placed within the VP in the syntax, since they are arguments of the verb or encode functional information (e.g. agreement) of the verb, respectively. In contrast to the arguments realised as full DPs, special clitics are not subject to standard syn- tactic rules. In order to account for their special position, it was assumed in the GB framework (for Romanian, for example by Dobrovie-Sorin, 1994) that clitics are ﬂ I will not go into more detail here about this theory, and restrict myself to present the assumptions which are needed for the topic of this paper. Minimalist Morphology concerns mainly agreement and irregular inflection phenomena. In Popescu (1997, 1998) I have argued for the analysis of obj-clitics as agreement markers in Romanian in this framework. I4 This is a simplification of the mechanism: the auxiliary clitics are also verbs that first form a verbal complex with the full verb with non filled argument positions, these are then filled by the obj-clitics. This is what happens syntactically. However, as clitics (units underspecified for min/max), auxiliaries form a CS with obj-clitics. IF In standard OT it is assumed that the evaluation does not take place in several steps, but that all can- didates are evaluated on the same level. Therefore, I assume that the CS is evaluated for its morpho- phonological wellformedness (the topic of this paper) at the same ‚time™ (on the same level) as it is con- stituted by the interaction of various constraints. I6 Zwicky and Pullum (1983) argue that only elements that are realised in the syntax are clitics. I adopt this view of clitics, and the fact that I assume that the CS is formed at the interfuce of the Lexicon with the syntax does not contradict this definition. The CS is free (+max) at the level of syntax. 788 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 base-generated in a given position and that the verb moves above the clitic (if it is inflected for the categories where the clitics surface after the verb). In contrast, I assume here, following Legendre (1999, 2000), that the placement of the clitics before or after the verb (the ‚special syntax™ of clitics) is ensured by syntactically and morphologically defined constraints of the ALIGN-family. As this is not the main concern of this paper, I will not analyse clitic placement more than necessary to account for the morpho-phonological facts. I will not be concerned either with morphological constraints on the clitic sequence which determine the order of clitics in the sequence either, as they are not relevant to the main subject of this paper (see Gerlach (1998) for an analysis of Romance clitic sequences from this point of view). I centrally deal here with the morpho-phono-prosodic properties of the CS, so I will restrict myself to the phono- logical, prosodic and morphological constraints which are involved in the selection of the forms presented in Section 3. In the following I will first present the constraints I assume (section 5.2). After- wards I will consider the interaction of these constraints and the way the candidates are evaluated (Section 5.3). 5.2. The constraints First the general phonological constraints in (22) are needed: ONSET, No CODA and No HIATUS. (22) Phonological constraints ONSET Syllables must have an Onset. No CODA Syllables must not have a Coda. No HIATUS Hiatus is not allowed. Correspondence constraints make sure that the phonological information of the input must correspond to sounds of the output. A MAX(~) constraint is needed for the vowel I: in Romanian, initial i is an epenthetical vowel which fills a nucleus of a syl- lable (see footnote 7). (23) Correspondence-constraintsﬂ MAX(PH-F) MAX(p) MAX(M-F) Phonological features in the input must have a correspondent in the output. Syllable-constituting segments, i.e. moras, in the input must have a correspondent in the output. Morphological features in the input must have a correspondent in the output. I have shown in Section 3 that there is a tendency for clitics to project a minimal number of syllables. I assume that there are two prosodic ALIGN-constraints which I7 DEP and IDENT constraints are also relevant for the CS, but I omit them here for reasons of space. A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 789 play a role in minimising the number of syllables of the CS: ALIGN L (w, STEM) and ALIGN R (0, STEM), respectively, which state that the left (right) edge of the phono- logical word must be identical with the left (right) edge of a stem. These constraints are violated if there is a syllable at the left (right) edge which belongs to the phono- logical word, but which is not part of the stem. These constraints are inspired by Selkirk™s (1995) Align-constraints. l8 I have extended the definition of these con- straints in so far as they are satisfied if what tops the edge of the stem is contained in a syllable of the stem. (24) Prosodic constraints ALIGN L(o, STEM) ALIGN R(o, STEM) The left edge of the o (phonological word) must be iden- tical with the left edge of the stem (syllables) The right edge of o must be identical with the right edge of the stem (syllables) These two constraints are in competition with another constraint which states that a syntactically free word, i.e. an entity which is marked [+max] (in the lexicon or at the interface between lexicon and syntax) must contain at least one syllable. As spe- cial clitics (respectively the CS, if there are more special clitics) are marked [+max] at the interface to syntax, this constraint also holds for them. This constraint is a wider version of the Word-Minimality-constraint (which states that a word must contain at least one foot). This constraint is also universally relevant and is ranked universally very high, as prosodically independent words tend to contain at least one syllable of their own. (25) MIN,, ([+max] + 2 lo) Entities that are projected into syntax, for example clitics, must contain at least one syllable As I have mentioned in the preceding section, the CS is a morphological unit that is not formed in the lexicon, but results from the interaction of constraints. Besides ALIGN-constraints which determine the order of clitics with respect to each other (see the end of Section 5. l), there are also ALIGN-constraints which refer to clitics in gen- eral and to verbal categories. These constraints contribute to the formation of the CS: the realisation of the clitics as a unit leads to the satisfaction of the ALIGNMENT constraints.19 (26) ALIGN L(CL, VP) The left edge of clitics coincides with the left edge of VPs. The special position after the verb for gerundives and imperatives follows from a high ranked constraint which requires that gerundives and imperatives are left aligned to the VP (see Anderson, 1997). This constraint ensures the correct place- I8 Selkirk™s (1995) constraints do not refer to stems, but to lexical words. I9 See Legendre (1999) and Gerlach (1998) for similar constraints in order to describe different phe- nomena of the pronominal clitics. 790 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 ment of the clitic without recurrence to a verb movement analysis, as it forces the clitics to be placed at the right side of the VP, i.e. to encliticise instead of procliti- cising as in other verbal forms. The constraint is violated if the clitic appears before the verb, without reference to the prosodic word it attaches to (the clitic may be attached to the prosodic word before the verb, see (18)). (27) ALIGN L(GER&IMP, VP) The left edge of verbs in Gerundive and Imperative coincides with the left edge of VPs Another morphological constraint is ‚CONSTITUENT™. It states that morphemes must project at least one syllable-constituent - an onset, a nucleus or a coda.*O The high ranking of this constraint explains why the clitic o cannot be realised as a glide. A glide does not fill a nucleus of a syllable. (28) CONST(ITUENT) Morphemes must project at least one syllable-constituent. (+ they cannot consist of a glide only) More generally, this constraint belongs also to the family of minimality-constraints, inasmuch as it limits the reduction of morphemes.*™ 5.3. Constraint interaction: The formation of the CS I will now proceed on exemplifying the evaluation of the candidates. I will show that the constraints I have presented, with a specific ranking, allow us to account for the selection of the different forms and for the exceptional case of splitting which I presented in Section 3. First, I will show how the interaction of the constraints explains the obligatory deletion of the central high vowel i in the CS on the one side and the optional dele- tion in a single clitic on the other side. In Tableau l** the CS containing a clitic with the vowel i is evaluated. The win- ning candidate (a) violates ALIGN L (0, STEM), since the clitics project the syllable at the left edge of the lexical word. It also violates MAX(~), since the epenthetic vowel i which fills a specified nucleus position (see footnote 7), is not realised. However, other candidates (b, c) which realise i and don™t violate MAX(~) violate ONSET and ALIGN L (co, STEM) twice since the CS then projects two syllables. The *O Note that the complexity of the information of the morphemes is not taken into account. Clitics cod- ify number and gender in one morpheme, but this does not lead to a violation of CONSTITUENT. 21 This constraint can be violated in the Romanian morphology: there are morphemes which consist of only a part of a coda, for example the plural masculine morpheme /i/ which is realised as a coda-final [j] if it is word-final. For this case, I assume that the constraint CONSTITUENT is dominated by another con- straint on the realisation of high vowels, *P/i,u# (Chitoran, 1997), which states that word-final high vow- els must not be parsed as syllable peaks. For the phenomenon I analyse in this paper, the crucial fact is that it is ranked higher than other phonological and morphological constraints. 22 For the sake of clarity, I will show only the constraints that are relevant for the present evaluation in each tableau and ignore the others. A. Popescu t Liqua II0 (2000) 773-799 791 double violation of ALIGN L (0, STEM) cannot be avoided by positioning a clitic after the verb, because candidate (d) is ruled out since it violates the placing-constraint ALIGN L (VP, CL) instead.

[am.] da.t [il.] * I * I *1 I I If the clitic with the vowel [i] appears without other clitics, both the form with the vowel and without it are possible realisations of the clitic (see (8b) in Section 3). The form without the vowel violates the word-minimality constraint (because the clitic, which is assigned [+max] in the paradigm, does not project a syllable by itself) and MAX(~) (because no segment occupies the nucleus of the syllable). The form with the vowel violates ALIGN L (CD, STEM) and ONSET instead. As the constraints are not ranked, both candidates are optimal (see Tableau 2).

This constraint is always violated if the initial i of the clitic is realised, because imperatives and gerunds always end in a vowel. This explains the contrast with the proclitic position. In the imperative, the obj-clitic cannot be proclitic because of the requirement that imperative has the first position in the VP (candidate C.).

Candidate (a) (the clitic without vowel) violates less constraints. If the vowel is skipped, there is a violation of MAX(PH-F) and of ALIGN L (0, STEM) (because the CS projects a syllable), but if a is realised it violates ALIGN L (0, STEM) twice. Furthermore, a hiatus between J and a results, which violates NOHIATUS. ONSET is also violated (see candidate (b) in Tableau 4). As in the case of I1 am dis- cussed above (Tableau l), the second violation of ALIGN L (0, STEM) cannot be avoided by the splitting of the CS (i.e. the realisation of one clitic after the full verb) because then the placing-constraint for clitics and MINI, would be violated instead. The form with the minimal number of violations wins. (This evaluation is almost identical to the evaluation for i.)

If this vowel is deleted, several constraints are violated: MAX(PH-F), No CODA and the MINIMALITY constraint, since the remaining consonant of the clitic must be integrated into a syllable of the lexical word (see Tableau 5). If the vowel is realised, the candidate only violates ALIGN R (0, STEM), and so this candidate wins. The posi- tion of the clitic cannot be changed because of the placement-constraint.

I I * I I* I I I I The constraint ALIGN L (IMP, VP) is higher ranked than the others, because the clitic cannot be placed before the verb in the Imperative even if in order to fulfil other con- straints. This cannot be proved in this instance, but it becomes clear if we try to place the clitic at a morphologically unpredicted position in other cases; I have not dealt with this sort of candidates for reasons of space. A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (20001 773-799 793 If a vowel can be reduced to a glide, it is reduced without violating any MAx-con- straints (see Tableau 6), because glides can be interpreted as allophones of the full vowels in Romanian, as I have already mentioned above (see Section 2). Vowels do not contain the specification about the syllabic position in their input (i.e., whether they must be realised as full vowels which project a nucleus, or as glides).23 Any deletion of a vowel would violate more constraints than the reduction to a glide. If the vowel is not reduced, it violates ALIGN L (CO, STEM) twice, since a full vowel pro- jects a supplementary syllable, and it additionally violates other constraints. As in the other cases, the clitics must be realised together because of the placing-con- straint.

This happens when the following clitic begins with a con- sonant and therefore no diphthong can be formed in order to give rise to a minimal number of syllables - see (4b). For e there is no such possibility in combination with 23 In contrast, I have assumed that there may be syllable segments in the underlying representation - as for the obj-clitics with initial i, see section 5.2 -, but this is not the unmarked case. 194 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 other clitics, because it is a direct object clitic and therefore only auxiliary clitics (which always begin with a vowel) can follow it (see Table 2).

I I The case of exceptional clitic split (see example (6)) can be accounted for if one assumes that the morpheme-minimality-constraint ‚CONSTITUENT™ is ranked higher than other constraints. One clitic must be realised at another position as usual, in vio- lation of the ALIGN L(CL,VP)-constraint. This gives rise to the clitic split, i.e. to the realisation of the clitic o encliticaly. The CS must split because otherwise it violates CONSTITUENT: glides like Q are not well-formed special clitics because they do not fill a nucleus of a syllable. In final position, the clitic o is always realised as a full vowel and is syllabified together with the verb, because participles end in a consonant, and so neither No HIATUS nor ONSET is violated for this clitic. If o remains in the CS without reduction of the vowel, CONSTITUENT is not violated, but the sequence contains two vowels and many other constraints are violated (see Tableau 9).24 Tableau 9: Exceptional Clitic Split for o (see (6a)) hpUt ofthe Cs: /O/ (%G.F.ACC) +/am/ (%G.PERF) I CONST ALIGN L I *No HIATUS !

The candidate [le o. am] would violate more constraints than the candidate which has a split sequence. Thus, it cannot be optimal (see 10). 24 This gives rise to the question as to why the clitic o must occur after the participle instead of chang- ing its position in the CS - for example occurring after the auxiliary. This position would produce the violation of other morphological constraints than the actually resulting split CS: there are constraints which regulate the order of clitics in the CS, which I will not discuss in this paper (see the end of sec- tion 5.1). But if the clitic o is not realised together with the other clitics, these constraints are vacuously satisfied. A.

This gives an example of why morphological information cannot be left unrealised in order to fulfil phonological constraints. If we assume that morphological MAX-constraints are ranked higher than the constraints discussed so far, the form with two syllables wins because a deletion of phonemes would leave morphological information umealised. If 1 is not realised, the informa- tion of the clitic il (~SG.M.ACC) has no correspondent in the output.

What seems to be relevant for the evaluation of the clitic outputs is that some morpholog- ical and morphophonological constraints are ranked higher than phonological con- straints. The data analysed in this paper do not speak for a more differentiated rank- ing among the members of each constraint group. It is possible that further research on other morphophonological phenomena in Romanian involving more data will show that some of the constraints of each group are also ranked to one another. To sum up this section, we have seen that the variation of the clitical forms can be explained if we assume that the underlying form is the maximal one, and the other forms result from the interaction of morphological and phonological constraints.

Conclusions I have shown that each special clitic has only one underlying form, and that the different realisations are due to the interaction of partially ranked prosodic and mor- phological constraints. Thus, the different forms are not idiosyncratic allomorphs as stated in other analyses of Romanian clitics. The unique case of clitic split was shown to result from the interaction of the constraints. The Optimality Theoretic analysis I suggested makes use of some theoretical assumptions of Minimalist Morphology, a lexicalist morphological theory. The cli- tics were analysed in this framework as underspecified entities which come together at the interface to syntax to form the ‚clitic sequence™, with the status of a morpho- syntactic unit. More constraints, phonological, prosodic and morphological ones, evaluate the generated forms and choose the optimal candidate. Morphological and phonological constraints interact, some of the morphological constraints being ranked higher than phonological constraints. The role of the prosodic categories and their interaction with the morphological ones would elucidate not only facts about clitics and clitic sequences, but also about other morphological units. In this paper I have analysed only the interactions between special clitics and between clitics and the stem. The interaction of other morphemes in the phonological word and the interaction of their phonological and morphological properties is subject to further research. For example, the role of con- straints that limit the shape of morphologically defined categories in general, as 798 A. Popescu I Lingua 110 (2000) 773-799 CONSTITUENT and MIN~CJ, is a perspective on Romanian morphology which has not yet been taken into account and which could give solutions for both morphologically and phonologically problematic phenomena.
