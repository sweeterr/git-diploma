It examines lan- guages from every continent, including several little-known languages drawn from the author™s pioneering fieldwork. By analysing the manifestations of classifiers over time in dif- ferent languages, the author shows that different types of classifiers have varying correlations with other grammatical categories and that they can develop, become obsolescent, or disap- pear in different ways. Prof. Aikhenvald presents a full typology of classifiers based on these contrasting parameters.

HUMANIORA nide-tom. 304) Helsinki: Bookstore Tiedekirja, 2000 198~~.

It is argued that the correspondences between African and Creole ideophones are both functional and substantial. By consequence, the suggested etymologies may contribute to the debate on creole genesis. AM E.

The author examines certain ‚dyadic misunderstandings™, and offers ‚triadic remedies™, which are all informed by a Peircean understanding of interpretation as the logical condition of signification. Paul BLOOM How children learn the meanings of words (Learning, Development, and Conceptual Change) London: The MIT Press, 2000 xii + 300~~. f24.95 ISBN 0-262-02469-l Contents: Series Foreword Acknowledgments l/First words 2/Fast mapping and the course of word learning 3/Ward learning and theory of mind 4/0bject names and other common nouns S/Pronouns and proper names 6/Concepts and categories 7/Naming representations g/Learning words through linguistic context 9/Number words lo/Words and concepts ll/Final words References Author index Subject index The acquisition of word meaning is one of the fundamental concerns of the study of mind. The author shows that children learn words through sophisticated cognitive abilities that exist for other purposes. These include the ability to in% others™ intentions, the ability to acquire concepts, an appreciation of syntactic structure, and certain general learning and memory abilities. Although other researchers have associated word learning with some of these ca- pacities, the author is the first to show how a complete explanation requires all of them.

In ad- dition, this volume presents a study of the relation between transposition and argument struc- ture, a declarative model of word formation applied to conversion in German, an analysis of Dutch verbal compounds and a study of the semantic aspects of nominalization. The evidence comes from a wide variety of languages.
