E-mail: fhnuesOl@athena.louisville.edu Pennsylvania State University was the site of the twenty-eighth annual Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (henceforth LSRL) in 1998. Editors J.-Marc Authier, Barbara E. Bullock and Lisa A. Reed selected the papers for inclusion in this volume with the assistance of a long list of distinguished extramural evaluators listed in the ‚Acknowledgments™ (p. v). The twenty-five authors of the nineteen ar- ticles in this LSRL volume have written about the following Romance languages: French (6 studies); Gallo-Romance (1 study); Italian (1 study); Romance (2 stud- ies); and Spanish (9 studies). Twelve studies address syntax and semantics, while the remaining six chapters address phonology and morphology. The authors are from academic institutions in Canada, Peru, Spain, The Netherlands, and the United States. The first chapter (‚Formal perspectives on Romance linguistics™, pp. 1-19) by editors J.-Marc Authier, Barbara E. Bullock, and Lisa A. Reed is an overview of the theo- retical perspectives presented in this volume. The editors/authors comment on cur- rent issues in phrase structure and adjunction, i.e., the elimination of Quantifier Rais- ing, an adjunction process, in favor of a strategy that has quantifier scope as a part of Case checking operations required independently in Minimalist theory (Chomsky, 1995; Homstein, 1995, 1999; Kitahara, 1996). Homstein™s (1999) approach to this important theoretical issue is to propose a movement analysis of obligatory control phenomena. Other syntactico-semantic issues discussed in this essay include func- tional projections and their features (Pollock, 1989; Thrainsson, 1996); feature checking and its consequences (Chomsky, 1995); the syntax-semantics interface (Diesing, 1992; Heim, 1982); the status of UG in second language acquisition (Clahsen and Muysken, 1996; Schachter, 1996); phonology and morphology 0378.2166/02/$ - see front matter 0 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Chapter 2 (‚Object bare plurals in Spanish and the semantics of personal A™, pp. 21-37) by Tonia Bleam points out that ﬁ[i]t is well-known that determinerless Noun Phrases (Bare NPs or BNPs) have a restricted distribution in Spanish (Casielles, 1996; Contreras, 1986; SuAer, 1982 and Torrego, 1984, inter alia)ﬂ (p. 21). The author further notes that ﬁ[i]t has also been claimed (Bruge and Brug- ger, 1996; Masullo, 1992) that BNPs in object position cannot be marked with the accusative a in Spanish. However, in this paper I show that there is no incompatibil- ity between DO BNPs and accusative a markingﬂ (p. 21). Although Bruge and Brug- ger (1996) argue that B[are]PL[ural]s are impossible with accusative a in Spanish, Bleam points out that this restriction is too strong since this construction is possible with different interpretations as seen in (1). (1) Juan y Maria rnataron u IingiEstas ayer. ‚John and Mary killed linguists yesterday.™ (p. 24) In (1) above, lingiiistas has an existential interpretation in which lingiiistas has the existential sense of ‚some™. Moreover, the author notes that in some cases a-marking is required as seen in (2). Without a, these sentences are ungrammatical. (2) Juan y Maria odian *(a) fildsofos. ‚John and Mary hate philosophers.™ (p. 24). The absence or presence of a depends upon whether case-marked bare plurals with differentiated scope are kinds while the those without are predicates that have to be incorporated. In the following chapter (‚Case feature checking and its consequences: Evidence from en-cliticization in French™, pp. 39-56), Marie Claude Boivin states that ﬁ[tlhe contrast in grammaticality between Genitive-en ‚its/their™ and Quantitative-en ‚of it/of them™ in French when they appear with derived subjects has been a long stand- ing problem in the syntax of Frenchﬂ (p. 39). The two manifestations of this syntac- tic phenomenon appear in examples (3) and (4). (3) Pierre en a 11~ [la preface t]. ‚Pierre read its preface.™ (p. 40) (4) Pierre en a nchett [trois t]. ‚Pierre bought three of them.™ (p. 40) The author points out that ‚[e]n-cliticization is subject to some well-known con- ditionsﬂ (p. 41). First, it must derive from an object position and second it is pro- hibited when its source is a thematic subject. Nevertheless, when en appears with a raised subject as in (5), G-en is licensed but Q-en is prohibited in this context as seen in (6). Book review I Lingua 112 (2002) 145-156 147 (5) [La prkface ti]j eni a e™te™ publie™e tj ‚Its preface has been published.™ (p. 41) (6) *[Trois ti]j e+ ont e™te™ publie™s tj. ‚Three of them have been published.™ (p. 41) Boivin explains this asymmetric syntactic phenomenon by arguing ﬁ. . . contrary to Pollock (1986) and Rizzi (1990), that the contrast does not crucially depend on the relation between en and its trace, but rather on Case checking. The remnant of G-en contains Case features and therefore can (and must) raise to subject position in order to check those features. The remnant of Q-en lacks Case features and therefore can- not raise to subject positionﬂ (p. 55). The fourth chapter (‚Assibilation in Ecuadorian Spanish: A phonology-phonetics account™, pp. 57-71) by Travis G. Bradley states that ﬁ[alssibilation is the process whereby an alveolar flap [r] or trill [r] is realized phonetically as a strident fricative [il. This occurs in many Spanish American dialects but is acoustically more marked in the Andean highlandsﬂ (p. 57). Bradley points out that Argtiello™s (1978, 1980) descriptive accounts of this dialect yield the following distributional facts about as- sibilation in the Andean region: (7a) The assibilated [f] has replaced the Standard Spanish trill phoneme in the informal register. (7b) The distribution of the Ecuadorian flap [r] and assibilated [r] is not exactly parallel to that of the Standard Spanish flap [r] and trill [r]. (p. 57) Bradley points out that he follows a model of phonology-phonetics interface which is a gestural/durational account suggested by Zsiga (1993, 1997). The author combines articulatory and perceptual to phonological phenomena. In the case of highland Ecuadorian assibilation, the distinctive phonetic pronunciation which results from ﬁ. . . an interaction of both categorical and gradient mechanisms, namely strengthening in the phonology and reduction, overlap, and blending in phonetic implementation. This account is motivated by in that it captures both (a) the phono- logical alternation between strengthened and non-strengthened rhotics and (b) the gradient spatio-temporal operations responsible for turbulent airflow in continuous speechﬂ (p. 69). Chapter 5 (‚How similar are conjuncts ? Against asymmetric conjunction™, pp. 73-88) by Jose Camacho reiterates that since the time of Chomsky (1957) the ‚default™ hypothesis has been that conjuncts belong to the same grammatical cat- egory. Nevertheless, the GPSG literature (Sag et al., 1985) has provided counter- examples to this assertion. These counterexamples, however, are subject to syntactic and possibly even semantic constraints. In this remainder of this study Camacho reviews coordinated verbal structures in Spanish which involve temporal and aspectual features. Negation and adverbials also affect the semantic interpretation of tense and aspect. All of these factors play a role in the formal structure of conjunction which may be symmetric or asymmetric. Camacho ultimately concludes that ﬁ. . . one must distinguish between hierarchical 148 Book r-eview I Lingua I12 (2002) 145-156 dominance among constituents and structural symmetry. Maintaining both notions forces us to adopt a structural representation in which conjuncts are specifiers of functional projections. This structure, in turn, provides evidence for word order effectsﬂ (p. 87). In the next chapter (‚Deriving Heavy NP-Shift in French™, pp. 89%105), J. Maarten de Wind discusses Heavy NP-Shift in French, as exemplified in (8) in which heavy objects can be shifted. (8) Jean a donnP [ci Pierre] (!e /iwe yue j™ai achete™ bier]. ‚Jean gave to Pierre the book that I bought yesterday.™ (p. 90) There are two theoretical approaches to these structures. Chomsky ( 1982) argues that Heavy NP-shift derives from right-adjunction to VP. Kayne (1994), however, believes that it is not the Heavy NP that moves but rather all of the material. De Wind examines this construction in Standard French and Canadian French (not to be confused with QuPhhcois). The author also notes that Heavy NP-shift may occur with subjects (p. 90). De Wind then examines constraints on these syntagms in Stan- dard and Canadian French. To explain the differences, the author points out that ﬁ. . _ [w]hile heavy NPs in Standard French display A™-properties, heavy NPs in Canadian French behave more like argumentsﬂ (p. 103). De Wind ultimately proposes that heavy NPs can merge in their most embedded level in Standard French, while in Canadian French ﬁ. . . the argument position is empty, in fact, not even projectedﬂ (p. 104). In the seventh chapter (‚The presuppositionality condition and Spanish clitic- doubled objects™, pp. 107-l 19), Jon A. Franc0 and Errapel Mejias-Bikandi state that: ﬁA clitic-doubled direct object in Spanish must be presuppositional: that is, it must be strongly quanti- fied or, if it is weakly quantified, it must receive a presuppositional interpretation (cf. also Suner IqY2). We call this the Presuppositionality Condition on Spanish Clitic-Doubled Objects. This condition is par- ticularly noticeable in the case of indefinite direct objects since an indefinite NP allows for both a pre- suppositional and a non-presuppositional reading.ﬂ (p. 107) In (9a), the sailor has a presuppositional reading because it alludes to a previously introduced set of sailors while (9b) may be either presuppositional or non-presuppo- sitional. (9a) Le, he visro a un marinero,. ‚I have seen one of the sailors.™ (9b) He \isro a un marinero. ‚I have seen a sailor.™ (p. 108) After a detailed examination of these structures the two authors conclude that ﬁ . . . it is possible to derive the Presuppositionality Condition from independent principles. In order to do so, we must assume that the launching site of overt oper- ations and the launching site of covert operations play different roles in determin- ing the interpretation of a sentence . . . we claim that only the launching site of covert Book review I Lingua 112 (2002) 145-156 149 operations plays a role in determining the mapping from syntactic structures onto logico-semantic representations (Diesing 1992)ﬂ (p. 108). In chapter 8 (‚Positional faithfulness vs. cue preservation: The case of nasal sequence resolution in Gallo-Romance™, pp. 121-133), Randall Gess examines a problematic issue in Gallo-Romance phonology. He states that: ﬁThis paper compares two approaches to assimilation that have been proposed in the Optimality Theoretic literature with respect to assimilations in sequences of nasal consonants in Gallo-Romance. The two approaches to assimilation that I will discuss are Beckman™s (1997) positional faithfulness model and km™s (1995a,b) cue preservation model. The two differ fundamentally in that Beckman™s model is primarily a phonological approach to assimilation while km™s model is primarily a phonetic approach.ﬂ (p. 121) The problem examined by Gess is the that of progressive assimilation (mn + m; femina jemna + fema) vs. regressive assimilation (nm -+ m; anima + anma + ama). Gess concludes that ﬁ. . . a cue preservation account is more successful than a positional faithfulness account in explaining the progressive assimilation in Gallo- Romance nasal sequences . . . ﬂ (p. 132). The next chapter (‚Passives and arbitrary plural subjects in Spanish™, pp. 135- 150) by Grant Goodall points out that ﬁSpanish and Italian, and perhaps other Romance languages, have both a standard passive construction as in ([lO]a), and what is sometimes called a third person plural arbitrary subject construction as in ([lO]b)ﬂ (p. 135). (10a) La noticia fue confirmada. ‚The news was confirmed.™ (lob) Confrmaron la noticia. ‚They (somebody or other) confirmed the news.™ (p. 135) Both forms are syntactically very distinct, yet they have similar interpretations, i.e., they both have an existential pro for their external argument. Cinque (1988) refers to the interpretation of (lob) as the ﬁexistentialﬂ reading. Following Baker (1988), Baker, et al. (1989), and Roberts (1987), the author assumes that ﬁ. . . this existential interpretation of the external argument in the passive construction arises because the external argument is syntactically representedﬂ (p. 136). Goodall notes that in the ﬁtrue passiveﬂ construction, it is possible to express the agent while in the arbitrary plural syntagm, it is not (pp. 136-137). Constructions such as (lob) which permit no agent forms raise questions about the U[niformity of] T[heta] A[ssignment] Hypothesis] (Baker, 1988: 46) because of their thematic similarity but different syntactic properties. Goodall also alludes to the indefinite se construction in Spanish and he exemplifies this construction in Por- tuguese and Italian. The author concludes that ﬁ[W]e have now examined three con- structions in Spanish and related languages which have very similar interpretations, but very different forms. I have proposed that, despite appearances, the syntactic position of their arguments is identical in all three cases. All have an external argu- ment in the canonical external argument position and the differences we observe 150 Book review I Lingua 112 (2002) 145-156 among the three result from small differences in the nature of this external argu- mentﬂ (p. 148). The tenth chapter (‚Spanish indefinites and type-driven interpretation™, pp. 15 l- 166) by Javier Gutierrez-Rexach deals with the semantics of Spanish plural indefi- nites. In general, indefinite expressions may be quantificational, i.e., they denote functions from properties to generalized quantifiers, or they represent choice func- tions. In this sense, Gutierrez-Rexach confirms Reinhart™s (1997) and Winter™s (1997) distinctions about these types of indefinites. In Spanish, there are two sets of indefinite determiners: (1) zln ‚one/a singular™, unos ‚one/a plural™; and algtin ‚some-singular™, and algunos ‚some-plural™. The author notes that there are restrictions on the occurrence of the two Spanish indefi- nites as seen in (11) and (12). (11) AlgunosPUnos atletas SOM inteligentes. ‚Some athletes are intelligent.ﬂ (p. 1.54) (12) Algunosl*Unos chicos se pusieron Ins pantalones. ‚Some boys put on their pants.™ (p. 155) Example (11) shows that cmos may not be the subject of an individual-level pred- icate. Example (12) demonstrates that unos N™ may not combine with distributive predicates. In contrastive focus, however, the constraints just noted are no longer operable. The distribution of these two forms leads Gutitrrez-Rexach to propose a third type of indefinite which he labels ﬁgroup indefinitesﬂ (p. 154). Example (13) demonstrates this group reading. (13) Unos soldados se dieron la vuelta. ‚A group of soldiers turned around.™ (p. 156) Example (13) shows that unos is both an existential and a group determiner, hence, it is only congruent with collective and group predication. Gutierrez-Rexach argues that ﬁ. . . the existence of this class of indefinites provides further support for a lexi- calist, type-drive and non-uniform approach to the semantics of indefinitesﬂ (p. 154). Chapter 11 (‚Minimalist access to UG in L2 French™, pp. 167-178) by Julia Her- schensohn deals with access to U[niversal] G[rammar] in second-language acqui- sition (Epstein et al., 1996). Herschensohn points out that ﬁ[o]n the one hand, incompleteness of L2 parameter setting is taken as evidence for no access to UG, while on the other, L2 acquisition of parameter values not available in Ll is taken to support full accessﬂ (p. 167). As the author points out, both positions on the access to UG hypothesis of second-language acquisition are too strong (p. 169). Minimalist theory (Chomsky, 199.5) however, provides a new approach to the UG access debate as enumerated in (14). (14) Minimalist perspectives a. Cross-linguistic variation is morpho-lexical. b. UG provides ‚perhaps only one™ I-language consistent with the data. Book review I Lingua 112 (2002) 145-156 151 c. Acquisition compromises parameter setting and mastery of lexical idiosyn- crasies. (p. 170) Herschensohn examines the extant studies of UG known as the V[erb] R[aising] P[arameter] to argue for access to UG. She ultimately shows that ﬁ. . . UG is avail- able to second language learners (LZers) based on four kinds of evidence from L2 French: 1) gaining a new parametric value 2) UG-constrained interlanguage 3) acquisition of subtle semantic features and 4) native-like competence. Such data pro- vide arguments for access to UG in the L2 acquisition of syntax and semantics, while supporting the Minimalist account of cross-linguistic variationﬂ (p. 167). In the following chapter (‚Conflictual agreement in Romance nominals™, pp. 179- 195), Aafke Hulk and Christine Tellier examine agreement as seen in (15). (15) Les mm-s de 1 ‚e™glise ont e™te™ repeints. ‚The walls of the church have been repainted.™ (p. 179) In (15), there is internal agreement of les with murs and external agreement of les murs with repeints. In (15), internal and external agreement coincide. Nevertheless, it is not possible to ascertain if the agreement is triggered directly by the lexical head or by the functional head D. In Romance, and in French specifically, there are exam- ples, called ‚qualitative nominals™, in which there is a definite distinction in the two types of agreement. Example (16), a pseudopartitive construction as discussed by Jackendoff (1977), Milner (1978), and Selkirk (1977), shows that the number and gender features of the past participle can be dictated by either the first or second noun and they appear to demonstrate conflictual agreement. (16) Une montagne de livres a e™te™ de™truitelont t?tP detruits cette nuit-l& ‚A mountain of books was/were destroyed that night.™ (p. 181) Example (17), a qualitative nominal, contrasts with the pseudopartitive in (16) and constitutes an authentic case of conflictual agreement. (17) Ton phe™nomPne de fille est hien *distrait.ldistraite. ‚That character of a daughter of yours is quite absent-minded.™ (p. 183) In (17), the first noun determines internal gender agreement while the second determines external agreement. This type of conflictual agreement occurs only in qualitative nominals with animate heads. The authors then explain, structurally, why qualitative nominals exhibit conflictual agreement. Comparative data from Italian and Spanish are also presented. The thirteenth chapter (‚Resyllabification precedes all segmental rules: Evidence from Argentinian Spanish™, pp. 198-210) by Ellen M. Kaisse makes the important point that, in the Spanish-speaking world, underlying /s/ appears as [h] in certain phonetic environments. Nevertheless, in five dialects examined by Kaisse, the /s/‚s 152 Book wvim. I Lirlgun I12 (2002) 14%I.76 that undergo aspiration depend upon interaction of the phonology with the morphol- ogy and with minor differences in the formulation of the rule. Aspiration in the R[io] N[egro] Alrgentinian] dialect of Spanish is distinct because ﬁ... forms like desigual ‚unequal™ are pronounced [de.si.gwal]. Evidently, there is a word-internal resyllabification process which removes the s from its coda before aspiration can get to itﬂ (p. 203). Kaisse also points out that her theoretical framework ﬁ. _ . is written in a derivational theory, one including cyclic application and strata1 assignments of rules, rather than in a non-derivational, constraint-based frameworkﬂ (p. 198). Chapter 14 (‚Objects and the structure of imperatives™, pp. 211--226) by Mihaela Pirvulescu and Yves Roberge examine imperative constructions exemplified in (I 8). (I 8) Munge ta soupe! ‚Eat your soup! ™ (p. 2 11) Imperatives have a number of distinctive properties, e.g., the use of null objects in instructional contexts (recipes; Massam and Roberge, 1989); the appearance of object clitics to the right of the verb in affirmative forms (Rooryck, 1992: 333-334; cf. Zanuttini, 1994, 1997); the use of pleonastic pronouns that correspond to some complement of the predicate. All of these facts show that with imperatives, there is an obligatory complement. This leads the authors to hypothesize that these forms ﬁ . . . correspond to a structure lacking a T-projection and that the state of affairs forces the projection of a complement positionﬂ (p. 225). The next chapter (‚Null objects and Dﬂ features in contact Spanish™, pp. 227-242) by Liliana Sgnchez points out that standard Spanish has undergone a shift from vari- able null objects to pronominal null objects in those areas of the Spanish-speaking worlds where there is contact between both types of languages, e.g., Basque (Franc0 and Landa, 1994, 1996; Landa, 1995) and Quechua (cf. Escobar, 1990; Landa, 1995; cf. Camacho et al., 1997). Standard Spanish requires an overt pronominal object while Andean Quechua does not (p. 230). In bilingual Spanish in this area, the pronominal objects appear in L2 Spanish. SBnchez™s explanation for this phenom- enon is that in Standard Spanish the Dﬂ that is the head of the null object in Stan- dard Spanish has the specifications [-definite, -specific] while Quechua may have a positive or negative value for these features. The effect of these differences means that Quechua-speaking bilinguals transfer this property to Spanish and they create a variety of Spanish where null objects have no definiteness nor specificity. In chapter 16 (‚Lexical conservatism in French adjectival liaison™, pp. 243-270), Donca Steriade examines French adjectival liaison. Thus, in French, the final con- sonants of the adjectives nouveau, bon, and petit are pronounced when followed by a masculine singular noun that begins with a vowel (Tranel, 1981). Steriade™s proposal for these adjectives is that these forms are syntactically masculine (p. 244). Further- more, she invokes the notion of lexical conservatism which she expresses as (19): (19) Property P of a novel form of a morpheme p has a precedent in property P of a listed form of p. (p. 244) Book review I Lingua I12 (2002) 145-156 153 The rest of this study addresses the rather intricate details of her proposal. The seventeenth chapter (‚Optional schwa deletion: On syllable economy in French™, pp. 271-288) by Bernard Tranel examines the phenomenon of O[ptimal] [Slchwa [Dleletion as seen in (20b,c): (20a) ce panneau ‚this panel™ (20b) [ sapano] (20~) [span01 (p. 271) In his Optimality theoretical proposal to this phonological process, the author argues that ﬁ... the complex properties of OSD can be captured by means of universal con- straints interspersed variably in correlation with speech rates/styles. The numerous factors contributing to OSD function as independently motivated linguistic proper- ties operating cross-linguisticallyﬂ (p. 286). In the penultimate chapter (‚Geminates and clusters in Italian and Piedmontese: A case for ranking™, pp. 289-303), Caroline Wiltshire and Elisa Maranzana note that in Italian, there is a distinction between long and short consonants, e.g., papa ‚pope™ vs. pappa ‚porridge™. Moreover, long segments occur as raddoppiamento sintattico across word boundaries ﬁ. . . when a word ends in stressed vowelﬂ (p. 289), e.g., cittci[pp]ulita ‚a clean city.™ Previous rule-based analyses have attempted to explain this phenomenon (Saltarelli, 1970; Vogel, 1977; Chierchia, 1986; Repetti, 1991). The present study examines this process within an Optimality theoretical framework. The authors note that their analysis does not require language-specific idiosyncratic rules, rather it uses universal constraints. In the final chapter (‚Structural case and tense construal™, pp. 30%327), Karen Zagona state that her study will ﬁ. . . argue that Structural Case/Agreement checking has the function of licensing the ‚Time Arguments™ with respect to which Tense Phrases are interpretedﬂ (p. 305). In her defense of this hypothesis that Case/Agree- ment has an interpretable function in grammar, the author demonstrates that ﬁ . . . structural Case licenses the visibility of ‚Time arguments™ of finite clauses. Clauses are taken to con- sist of two interacting sets of predicate-argument structure: the standard verbal predicate and its argu- ments, and the abstract temporal arguments selected by TP. These arguments, which presumably have no theta-roles and no intrinsic semantic feature, were proposed to be licensed by features associated with standard argumentsﬂ (p. 325). An index of terms and concepts (pp. 329-333) complements this volume. Missing from this volume are the author index (Lema and Trevifio, 1998: 367-372; Schwe- gler et al., 1998: 333-336) and the language index (Lema and TreviAo, 1998: 378-379; Schwegler, et al., 1998: 337-339) found in the two most recent LSRL pro- ceedings volumes. Included, however, is a useful list of contributors (pp. ix-xi) with complete address including e-mail access. Co-editor Marc Authier has also included a brief, whimsical poem (p. xii) entitled ‚Le pret-a-photographier™ dedicated to ﬁ... past, present, and future editors of volumes of selected papers from the Linguisric Symposium on Romance Languagesﬂ (p. xii). This is a very well-edited volume which belongs in the library of every dedicated Romance linguist. 154 Book roietr~ I Lingua 112 (2002) 14%IS6 References Argiiello, F., 1978.
