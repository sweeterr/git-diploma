(The Phonology of the World™s Languages) Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1999. Pp. xvi+368. Reviewed by T.A. HALL, Institut fur Linguistik, University of Leipzig, Brtihl 34- 50, 04109 Leipzig, Germany hall@rz.uni-leipzig.de The phonology of English (henceforth PE) is an additional volume in the series The phonology of the world™s languages, published by Oxford University Press. As the title of the book suggests, PE considers various aspects of English phonology from the perspective of Optimality Theory (henceforth OT) with particular reference to prosodic categories. Hammond™s data are drawn primarily from the variety of English commonly referred to as General American. The approach to English phonology in PE differs radically from the one taken by the majority of generative phonologists. In contrast to Chomsky and Halle (1968) as well as much subsequent work in Lexical Phonology (e.g. Halle and Mohanan, 1985; Borowsky, 1990; Giegerich, 1999), Hammond does not discuss morpho- phonemic alternations motivating synchronic rules such as Trisyllabic Shortening, Velar Softening, Vowel Shift etc., nor does he posit highly abstract underlying forms. Instead, PE is a ‚surface™ oriented treatment dealing with two general areas of English sound structure (and their interaction): phonotactics (i.e. the distribution of sounds within syllables, as well as the distribution of various allophones), and word stress patterns. Due to the complexity of the English data Hammond restricts his treatment to monomorphemes, although on occasion bimorphemic forms are also present in his analysis. While I think that it is perfectly fair to present a book length analysis on highly restricted topics in a single language, I do not think that PE fits well in the book series. According to the blurb on the inside cover of PE the books in the Languages of the world series are supposed to provide both a broad overview of many aspects of the phonology of a particular language as well as ﬁcomprehensive references to recent and more classical studies of the languageﬂ. Hammond does neither. What we have is a book written on very narrow topics of English phonology and very little in * I would like to thank David Holsinger for comments on an earlier version of this review. 0378-2166/01/$ - see front matter 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The list of references is very short (31/2 pages) in light of the fact that literally hundreds of works have appeared through the years dealing with various aspects of the sound structure of English. PE consists of nine chapters, a Subject Index and a very useful Word Index, which lists the page number(s) for every English word dealt with in the book. A minor point concerns the section entitled ‚Transcription™ (p. xv). Hammond writes that the phonetic symbols he employs in PE are mostly drawn from the IPA, the only exceptions being [S i E fl, which correspond to IPA u 3 g d?] respectively. An omis- sion from this chart is the retroflex approximant Y, which Hammond transcribes as [r]. ([r] is an alveolar trill in IPA.) Chapter 1 (‚Some basic ideas™) is intended to provide the reader with some fun- damentals of English sound structure, e.g. the inventory of sounds and some gener- alizations concerning the distribution of aspirated consonants, nasalized vowels, tense and lax vowels, word-initial two member consonant clusters, and to introduce the fundamentals of Optimality Theory. I found it unfortunate that certain well- known topics in English phonology are not discussed in Chapter 1 (or in any of the subsequent chapters), e.g. the glottalized allophones of voiceless stops, flaps, the velarization of /l/. Chapter 1 consists of seven sections: ‚The sounds of English™ (9 1. l), ‚Characterizing the sounds of English™ (0 1.2), ‚Phonological generalizations™ ($1.3), ‚Treating phonological generalizations™ (0 1.4), ‚Optimality theory™ (9 1.5) ‚Organization of the book™ ($1.6) and ‚Further reading™ ($1.7). Hammond writes in the Preface that PE will be of use to readers ﬁwho know rel- atively little about phonologyﬂ. An examination of Chapter 1 reveals that this is not true because the author employs terminology throughout the first chapter (and in the following chapters) without explanations, e.g. ‚minimal pair™ and ‚limited distribu- tion™ (p. 2), ‚features™ and the theory of ‚feature geometry™ (p. 6), ‚complementary distribution™ (p. 8), and ‚natural classes™ (p. 12). Hammond clearly expects his read- ers to be familiar with the basics of phonetics, since he uses terms such as ‚retroflex approximant™,‚glides™ and ‚dental fricatives™ without comment (p. 2). On p. 5 he refers to ‚palatals™ and ‚labiovelars™ without giving examples of either two types of sound. What is more, the list of English consonants on the same page does not include either of these two terms. Apparently ‚palatals™ for Hammond means not only [y]= IPA b]), but also [S i E fl, which he refers to in the section ‚Transcription™ (p. xv) as ‚palatoalveolars™. Hammond assumes without comment that English voice- less stops and the affricate [E] are aspirated word-initially, although many descrip- tions of English do not assume the affricate is aspirated (see, for example, Lade- foged, 1993: 50, 89). In his discussion of the tense vs. lax distinction among vowels, Hammond classi- fies [o] and [a] as tense (p. 6). While there is a tradition in English phonetics and phonology for this classification (see Giegerich, 1992: 95ff.; Ladefoged, 1993: 87), Hammond could have mentioned that [o a] are often treated as lax in phonology text- books (e.g. Halle and Clements, 1983: 33; Katamba, 1989: 54).™ A phonotactic ™ However, Chomsky and Halle (1968: 176) and Davenport and Hannahs (1998: 93) classify English [3] as [-tense]. Book review I Lingua 1 I1 (2001) 235-242 231 argument for analyzing [o a] as tense does not emerge until his discussion of the dis- tribution of word-final vowels (pp. 10-l l), in which Hammond presents data show- ing that all and only tense vowels can occur word-finally. In order to account for the existence of [o a] in this position (e.g. maw [mo], ma [ma]), Hammond classifies these two vowels as tense. Paradoxically, I found phonotactic evidence in the latter chapters of the book (not mentioned by Hammond) suggesting that [o a] pattern as lax (see below). Hammond™s approach to OT differs from the one taken by other authors. First, OT is usually described as a theory involving a conflict between (surface) marked- ness constraints and (input-output) faithfulness constraints (see Kager, 1999: 4ff.), but Hammond does not make it clear that markedness is involved. In fact, ‚marked- ness™ is not even listed in the Subject Index to PE. Second, constraints in OT are usu- ally assumed to be phonetically grounded and that they derive typological motiva- tion (see Kager, 1999: 11); hence it is not surprising that many authors operating within the OT framework go to a great deal of effort to give a ‚functional™ explana- tion for the constraints they posit. In contrast, in the bulk of PE Hammond spends lit- tle or no time providing phonetic motivations for his constraints. An example where he could have done so is the section in Chapter 1 on vowel nasalization. Here Ham- mond posits a constraint saying that a vowel is to be nasalized before a nasal conso- nant but makes no comment at all on the phonetic naturalness of this constraint nor on its typological motivation.* At many points in PE Hammond proposes constraints that go diametrically opposed to typological findings. For example, in Chapter 4 he has a constraint called MAX-CODA (p. 134) which ensures that the optimal parsing for VCCV is VCC.V, contrary to the well-known principle of onset maximization (see Kahn, 1976; Clements and Keyser, 1983).3 Chapter 2 (‚Syllables™) illustrates by way of English examples the importance of the syllable and provides a brief OT account of some syllable-based phenomena of English. The chapter is divided into four sections: ‚Intuitive evidence for the sylla- ble™ (§2.1), ‚Distributional evidence for the syllable™ (§2.2), ‚A general theory of the syllable™ ($2.3) and ‚Further reading™ ($2.4). In contrast to traditional approaches within generative phonology, Hammond does not derive [n] from /nk/ or /ng/ and instead simply considers the surface distribution of [n]. The generalization he establishes is that [IJ] cannot occur syllable-initially - a conclusion that seems reasonable in light of the lack of English words beginning with [r~] and the nonexistence of [IJ] after a consonant and before a vowel, i.e. in VC.rjV. However, a consequence of Hammond™s analysis of the velar nasal is that an intervocalic [r~] is argued to be in syllable-final position, e.g. dinghy is syllabified as [drrJ.i] (p. 38). Hammond could have considered treating intervocalic [r~] as ambisyl- labic at this point in his analysis (see, for example, Kahn, 1976); if this treatment 2 In contrast, Kager (1999: 28ff.) provides a discussion of vowel nasalization in the OT framework in which the constraint(s) are phonetically grounded. 3 However, in other chapters, Hammond provides some useful typological information. For example, in Chapter 5 he devotes a lengthy section to typological remarks concerning the rankings of stress- related constraints. 238 Book review I Lingua 1 I I (2001) 235-242 were carried through then one could posit that the [r~] in dinghy is ambisyllabic and that [r~] cannot occur in absolute (i.e. non-ambisyllabic) syllable-initial position. In Chapter 6 Hammond makes it clear that he believes in ambisyllabicity (although it would be more accurate to characterize it as ‚gemination™; see below), but he could have mentioned his view in Chapter 2 in connection with the distribution of [r~]. What is more, Hammond does not discuss the fact that his syllabification [drrJ.i] vio- lates the well-known universal generalization that VCV is syllabified as V.CV and not as VC.V.4 I had some minor comments regarding Chapter 2. Hammond writes that the most obvious evidence for the syllable is that native speakers have intuitions that, for example, ﬁhat has one syllable, pony has two syllables and potato has three sylla- blesﬂ (p. 31). This example does not necessarily mean that speakers can count sylla- bles, but instead that they can count vowels; thus, to make his point clear, Hammond needs an example of an English word with a syllabic consonant which counts as a syllable peak. The author writes that onset consonants are not moraic in any lan- guage (p. 43), but some languages have word-initial geminates, which are generally assumed to be moraic. Chapter 3 (‚English syllables: Margins and consonants™) provides extensive data, and an OT analysis thereof, of initial, medial and final consonant clusters of English. The chapter is divided into seven sections: ‚Word onsets™ (93.1), ‚Word-final clus- ters™ ($3.2), ‚Medial clusters™ (§3.3), ‚Clusters vs. margins and the sonority hierar- chy™ (§3.4), ‚Linear restrictions™ (93.5), ‚Summary™ ($3.6) and ‚Further reading™ (03.7). .The strength of Chapter 3 lies in Hammond™s systematic and thorough descriptive approach to English phonotactics. The reader will find in this chapter extensive data sets in which possible and impossible sequences of consonants in initial, medial and final position are provided. An optimality-theoretic approach to English phonotactics is proposed which accounts for the complicated English data. One of the innovations of PE is Hammond™s proposal that certain constraints are ‚derived™ (pp. 88-89). For example, consider the constraints *onset/obstruent-nasal and *onset/nasal-approxi- mant, which rule out a sequence of obstruent+nasal and nasal+approximant in the onset respectively. The relative ranking of these two constraints is determined by comparing the relative ranking of the simplex constraints corresponding to their first members. Since *onset/nasal outranks *onset/obstruent, *onset/nasal-approximant outranks *onset/obstruent-nasal. Hammond follows a long tradition in English phonology (to which he does not refer) of analyzing certain word-final coronal consonants as extrasyllabic, i.e. struc- turally unassociated with the syllable. What makes Hammond™s approach notewor- thy is that unlike many earlier writers he does not assume a later stage in a deriva- tion after which the extrasyllabic consonant is associated with the syllable, but instead that extrasyllabicity exists in the surface representation. For example, Ham- mond has a tableau in which the correct candidate for the English word apt is one in It should be noted that Hammond follows earlier writers who argued that VCV is syllabified as VCV when the first vowel is stressed, e.g. Hoard, 1971; Selkirk, 1982. Book review I Lingua I1 I (2001) 235-242 239 which the t is unassociated with the syllable (= ‚unparsed™ in Hammond™s terminol- ogy). Unfortunately it is not clear in this tableau why the intended winner is better than one in which the r is parsed, i.e. [.=pt.]. Some of the phonotactic generalizations in Chapter 3 require brief comments. Hammond posits a constraint he dubs ‚coronal dissimilation™ (p. 55), which states that ﬁcoronal stops do not cluster with the lateral [l] in onsetsﬂ, but it is not clear why it is a dissimilation. On the same page there is a summary of possible two-con- sonant word onsets but the prose statement apparently allows nonattested clusters (e.g. the clause ﬁ[s] followed by . . . a fricative . ..ﬂ apparently subsumes *[&I sS]). According to the generalization on p. 59 called ‚Unsuffixed NC Codas™ unsuffixed nasal+consonant codas consist of a nasal followed by a homorganic voiceless obstru- ent or [d z], e.g. hint, land, lens, but a nasal can be followed by m as well, e.g. hinge, range. It is unclear why Hammond considers filth, wealth, and Mars to be ‚suffixed™ words (pp. 61-62). Chapter 4 (‚English syllables: Peaks and moras™) discusses cooccurrence restric- tions involving combinations of vowels and consonants. The chapter is very system- atic in its presentation of the kinds of vowels that can precede and/or follow a con- sonant or a combination of consonants and is therefore useful from a descriptive point of view. An OT analysis is proposed which relies heavily on moraic structure that is intended to account for the cooccurrence restrictions discussed. The chapter consists of six sections: ‚Vowels and diphthongs™ (94.1), ‚Cooccurrence restrictions™ ($4.2), ‚Mora-based restrictions™ (§4.3), ‚Syllabic consonants and [r]™ ($4.4), ‚Sum- mary™ (94.5) and ‚Further reading™ ($4.6). At a number of points in Chapter 4 the data Hammond presents suggest that [o a] - two sounds that are analyzed as tense (p. 6) - pattern phonotactically as lax. For example, Hammond writes that only lax vowels occur before the velar nasal (p. 113), but the set of vowels that surface before [r~] subsumes [o a], e.g. long [lor~].~ A sim- ilar problem involves the set of vowels that occur before [mp] and [rJk] (p. 117). Hammond notes that only lax vowels occur here, e.g. limp, sunk, but there are also examples in his list with [o] and [a], e.g. stomp, pomp, honk, conk. The author shows that only lax vowels surface before word-final /sp sk/ (p. 115) and writes on the fol- lowing page that ﬁthe only tense vowel that occurs in this position is [a]ﬁ, e.g. wasp, mosque, but if [a] were lax then it would not be exceptional. A similar conclusion can be reached concerning the data set on p. 118 illustrating the occurrence of vow- els before final /ps ts ks/. Hammond concludes that with the exception of hoax [hoks], only lax vowels surface before final [ks], e.g. fix, hex, crux, but [a] occurs here as well, e.g. OX.~ Hammond proposes throughout PE many unconventional syllabifications. For example, in Chapter 4 (and later on in Chapter 6) he argues that, depending on what consonants and vowels are involved, VCCV is parsed VCC.V, e.g. an intervocalic [lt] in a word likefealty is syllabified [filt.i] (p. 231). As I mentioned above, I find it 5 In many dialects of English, including my own, there is no [a] and all [D]S are replaced by [a], thus long is pronounced [lore]. 6 Confusingly, Hammond writes (p. 118) that [D] generally occurs in only k-vowel contexts. 240 Book review I Lingua III (2001) 235-242 disturbing that Hammond does not tell his readers that what he is doing is diamet- rically opposed to the long established principle of onset maximization. Ham- mond™s reasons for the VCC.V parsing are often not convincing. For example, in order to rule out the two diphthongs [aw oy] before word-final and medial [sk] he makes two assumptions (p. 133): (i) the constraint is syllable-based, and (ii) medial [sk] belongs to the previous syllable, i.e. Vsk.V. It is not clear why one cannot assume a purely linear constraint that makes no reference to the syllable ruling out [aw oy] before [Sk]. Hammond™s OT treatment predicts the VCC.V pars- ing because he posits the constraint I referred to above (i.e. MAX-CODA) otherwise unattested in the phonological literature that says VCCV is optimally parsed vcc.v (p. 134). Chapter 5 (‚Stress, accent and feet™) serves as a prelude to the following chap- ters, which deal specifically with English stress, by introducing the metrical foot on the basis of various ‚external™ arguments (e.g. language games, nursery rhymes, expletive infixation). The remainder of the chapter shows how feet are parsed in OT. Chapter 5 consists of six sections: ‚What is stress?™ ($5.1), ‚What is a metri- cal foot?™ (&5.2), ‚Intuitive evidence for the foot™ (95.3), ‚Distributional evidence for the foot™ (§5.4), ‚General theory of the foot™ ($5.5) and ‚Further reading™ (95.6). Hammond states at the begining of the chapter that the foot ﬁincludes one or two syllablesﬂ (p. 151) and then presents the foot structure for examples like banana in which the first syllable is unparsed. Although he does discuss evidence in the fol- lowing section for unparsed syllables (e.g. the ‚Name Game™) the analysis at this point in the chapter will come as a surprise to readers not familiar with the assump- tion in metrical phonology that English feet are maximally trochaic. Chapter 5 con- tains a lengthy section on typology (pp. 172-191), in which the author shows that one would expect other languages to exist with the alternate rankings of the same constraints necessary for English. I found the section useful and informative but at this point in the book one wonders why no typology was proposed for the phonotac- tic constraints posited in earlier chapters. Chapter 6 (‚Syllables and stress™) discusses the effects of stress on syllabification. There are four sections: ‚Basic distributional regularities™ ($6.1), ‚The analysis™ ($6.2), ‚Summary™ (§6.3), ‚Further reading™ ($6.4). In Chapter 6 Hammond discusses at length the constraint BIMORAICITY (p. 207ff.), which ensures that stressed vowels are tense (i.e. bimoraic) an not lax (i.e. monomoraic) in word-final position and prevocalically. In order to prevent precon- sonantal stressed lax vowels from surfacing as tense in conformance with BIMORAIC- ITY, Hammond proposes that such syllables are closed by the following consonant. For example, the name Minnie [mmi] is syllabified [mm.i], where both the [I] and the [n] are dominated by a separate mora and the [n] is in absolute syllable-final position (p. 212). There is independent evidence not discussed in PE suggesting that syllabi- fications like VC.V cannot be correct. The voiceless stops of English have glottal- ized allophones in syllable-final position when these stops are unreleased (see Kahn, 1976: 84ff.; Giegerich, 1992: 220-221). Some representative examples which con- tain a glottalized /t/ have been provided in (1): Book review I Lingua I1 1 (2001) 235-242 241 (1) cat [khat7] art [a-e atlas [aetr.las] chutney [$t?.ni] When Hammond provides tableaus like the ones on pp. 229-23 1, in which the cor- rect outputs for pity, vanity and fealty are [piti], [vaenat.i] and [filt.i] respectively, one wonders (i) how Hammond proposes to block glottalization from applying to the syllable-final /t/ and (ii) how he accounts for the correct phonetic forms with a flap, i.e. pi[r]y and vani[r]i. In Chapter 6 I found two generalizations concerning English sound structure that show, contrary to Hammond™s analysis, that [a o] pattern as lax and not as tense (see the discussion above). First, in words with trochaic stress with intervocalic [sp sk] clusters (pp. 238-239) the first vowel is consistently lax, e.g. the [I] in biscuit. Sig- nificantly, there are words in Hammond™s list like auspice and gospel, in which both [a o] occur in this position as well. Second, Hammond provides a long list of words containing word-internal [yu], e.g. annual, continue, granule, and concludes that this sequence can occur after a coronal sonorant only when the preceding vowel is lax (p. 242ff.). Included in his list are the words voluble and soluble, in which [a] sur- faces before the coronal sonorant [l]. Chapter 7 (‚The rightmost stress™) is the first of two chapters discussing the regu- larities governing the distribution of stress placement in the final three syllable win- dow of monomorphemic words, e.g. nouns like America, animal, agenda, canoe, alarm, verbs like remedy, abbreviate, and adjectives like sinister. The chapter pro- vides one of the first detailed analyses of English word stress in an OT framework. A strength of the chapter is that extensive data sets which demonstrate that segmen- tal, prosodic and grammatical information have a profound effect on English stress. The chapter consists of eight sections: ‚Review of previous results™ (47.1), ‚The basic analysis™ (§7.2), ‚The role of syllable weight™ (§7.3), ‚Other nominal stress pat- terns™ ($7.4) ‚Final syllables™ (97.5), ‚Verbs and adjectives™ ($7.6) ‚Summary™ ($7.4), and ‚Further reading™ (37.7). Chapter 8 (‚Other stresses™) discusses the regularities governing the distribution of stresses not dealt with in the previous chapter, e.g. pretonic stresses in words like raccoon, chimpanzee, Indianapolis. The chapter consists of six sections: ‚Nonright- most stresses™ (§8.1), ‚Long vowels™ (§8.2), ‚Nonfinal primary stress™ (§8.3), ‚Mor- phemes and feet™ ($8.4), ‚Summary™ (§8.5), and ‚Further reading™ (98.6). To summarize, PE provides a detailed OT based account of phonotactics and stress and their interaction in English. While I think many of Hammond™s proposals will be greeted with skepticism in the phonological community, I think the book pro- vides much food for thought and will be of intererest to all lingists concerned with English phonology.™ ™ I list here some errors I found in PE: On p. 32 the [p] in picnicking and on p. 33 the [E] in chin are not transcribed with aspiration.
