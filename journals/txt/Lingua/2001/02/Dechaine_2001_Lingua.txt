Before an Accusative-marked complement, the mherent low tone of a monosyllabic verb is suppressed. Conversely, m certain empty functional head posit,ons, a 'spurious' high tone appears Both phenomena arguably demonstrate the interaction of labeled phrase-struc- ture with tonal feet. Accordingly, Yor6bfi prosody counts as an example of direct access by phonology to surface syntax, as proposed by Kalsse (1985) and Odden (1990a). © 2001 Elsevter Science B.V. All rights reserved 1.

Such phenomena raise the question of whether syntactic objects affect phonology directly, or whether syntax and phonology are mediated by prosodic rep- resentations which are less than fully syntactic, though they may have phrasal char- acterlstics. Selkirk's (1972) dissertation developed the indH'ect mapping theory of The Sound Pattern of Enghsh (Chomsky and Halle, 1968)' only a subset of post- cyclic phrase boundaries are relevant to the application of phonological rules. ~ The contrary view - direct mapping - was arttculated around the same time, in Bresnan's claim that Chomsky and Halle's (1968) "Nuclear Stress Rule is ordered within the transformational cycle" (1971' 257, emphasis added). In its third decade, the debate is far from done (cf. Boolj, 1992). Kalsse (1985) and Odden (1990a) defend direct mapping, Nespor and Vogel (1986) take the con- trary view, and others have proposed hybrid theories (Selklrk, 1984a, 1986; Halle and Marantz, 1993) Moreover, recent reassignments of the functions of grammahcal modules in principles and parameters theories have reframed the discussion. In par- tlcular, economy-based analyses -whether derlvatlonal (Chomsky, 1995) or repre- sentational (RlZzl, 1997) - force a reappraisal of the architecture of the grammar as it pertains to overt syntax, w~th consequences In turn for the analysis of syntax-sen- sitxve phonological processes. This paper considers audible effects of phrase structure - principally, the suppres- sion of lexlcal low tone m Yorfibfi - and argues that direct mapping permits a 'null' or nonstlpulative theory consistent with independent generahsatlons m the grammar (Clnque, 1993). More abstractly, phonological and syntactic representations respect the same structural condttions on locahty and recoverability. Most abstractly, there IS a convergence of syntactic and prosodic conditions on the hcensmg of null posi- tions, in the form of the phonosyntacttc ECP which requires that an ungoverned null functional head be prosodically strong. This result converges with Longobardl (1994) who argues that null functional heads obey strict recoverability conditions Understood analogously, the phonosynlacttc EcP is one of the mechanisms available in Universal Grammar to satisfy recoverabdity. Section 2 mtroduces the phenomenon Section 3 surveys ItS syntactic environ- ment: the left edge of case-marked DPs, as well as certain CPs. The former are widely d~scussed m the hterature, the latter less well so. Section 4 derives the effect from the direct co-representation of phonology and syntax, what Rlzzl and Savola (1992) call phono~yntax : Specifically, the phenomenon is argued to reflect a recov- erabihty condition on null functional heads. Section 5 concludes by considering the relationship of this condition to other phonological and syntactic constraints. Selklrk's me&atlng representations are derived according to an algorithm that slmphfles syntactm bracketing The separate theory ot LexJcal Phonology addresses structule-sensltJve word-internal phonology, although the distinction between 'lextcal' and 'post-lextcal' phonology remains problematic (cf Boolj and Rubach 1987) Pulleyblank (1986a 7) dlstmgmshes lextcal fiom phrasal phonology b) charactensmg the lauer as exceptlonles,, Some exceptlonles,, processe% e g Yor~?.tb~t gerund reduphca- tlon, are nonelheles., treated as lexlcal via feedback loops m stratal ordermg (Akmlabf and Oy6bfid6. 1987, Pulteyblank and Akmlabi, 1988) Also known as wnta.~-phrmolo~,,~ ~ohabltat;on (Ddchalne and Manfredk 1995) R -M Ddchame / Lingua 111 (20(91) 81-130 83 2. L-drop in monosyllabic verbs Based on their forms in isolation (e.g. in imperatives), in deverbal root nouns and in some nominalisations, Yorfibd monosyllabic verbs divide into three tone classes: low (L), mid (M), high (H). Consider the gerunds in (1). 3 (1) a. mr-m6 [[rnim55]] L tone verb i GER-knOW 'knowing' b. jf-je [[d3id3~]] M tone verb GER-eat 'eating' c. kf-k,6 [[k~fi]] H tone verb GER-build 'building' In Standard Yorfibfi, before a direct object (DP), monosyllabic L-tone verbs are pronounced M (Abraham, 1958: xiii; Bfiffagb6s& 1967: 23; Aw6bfiltlyl, 1978a: 52). Call this L-drop. In the same context, monosyllabic H- and M-tone verbs maintain their respective lexical tones :4 (2) a. Mo mo i16 e r~. [[...mS...11 ls know house GEN 3S 'I know his/her residence' b. Mo je ilfi [[...d3~...]] ls eat okro 'I ate (some/the) okro' c. Mo k6 i16. [[...k5...11 ls build house 'I built a house' L-drop is obligatory before object DPs bearing any tones. But before an embedded clause (CP), an L-tone verb surfaces with either L or M, correlated to a difference in 3 Data are presented in the orthography, which marks L and H tones with grave [" ] and acute ['] accents respectwely (B~i~gb6st, 1970a). M tone is unmarked m the orthography, but where phonetic representa- tions m double brackets are added for clarity, a macron [[-]] m&cates M. Following the convention of the Yorfibd linguistic community m Nigeria, phonetic contour tones are transcribed as sequences of level tones. This makes no claim as to vowel length, which is orthogonal to present concerns - although lmpresslomsucally vowels with contour tones seem longer The superscript exclamation mark represents downstep - what B~,Tagb6s6 (1966b) calls the "assimilated L tone". 4 O. Aw6b01tlyl (p.c) observes that L-drop falls to occur m eastern dialects such as Ofid6 All data reported here belong to Standard YorOb& broadly identified with the &alect of Qy6 and its descendant towns Keeping to the practice of Yorfibfi hngmsts, I m&cate L-drop m orthographic transcription (as well as m phoneuc double brackets).

Throughout, the retentmn or non-retentmn of the lexlcal L tone has interpretive consequences. (4) a. Mo gb~ [kf 6 lol. [[ gbh...]] ls receive c 3s go 'I agree that s/he should go' b.

In other words, L-drop ~s a phonological process whose apphcatlon is constrained by syntax/semantics Accordingly, an analysis faces two tasks (i) to account for the phonetic effect of tone change from L to M; (u) to characterlse the syntactlco-semantic contexts that block or trigger it. As a first step, consider how earher stu&es have addressed these points 2.1 The mght context Standard autosegmental analyses of Yorfib4 tone (Akmlabf, 1985: Pulleyblank, 1986a) hold that both L and H are marked by tonal features in underlying representa- tion, while M is the pronunciation of tonelessness - the absence of tone specification (cf. also Kaye, 1981). From th~s standpoint, that L tone verbs ever surface with M does not require substitution of M for L, but can be understood as rule-governed dele- tion of lexical L and default pronuncmtlon of the resultant toneless syllable As the context of the rule. Pulleyblank (1986a 117) posits a right-adjacent NP' (6) L---~@/_Iv [YP R -M D~chatne / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 85 For an example like (2a), the derivation proceeds as follows. In the input, only L and n tones are specified, (7a). L-drop applies to m,b 'know', (7b). Subsequently, toneless vowels are assigned M by default, (7c). (7) a. M o [m o Iv [il 6 e r ~, ]NP INPUT I I I L H L b. Mo [m o ]v [il 6 e r ~, ]NP L-DROP I I I Q~ H L c. Mo [m o ]v [il 6 e r ~ ]N~ OEFAULTM I I I I I I M M M H M L A problem for (6) is posed by the fact that embedded CPs can also trigger the rule. Carstens (1987: 10) attempts to handle this by restating the context in terms of case features so that a verb's lexical L is deleted before any Accusative XP: (8) L --'-> ~ / --Iv [XP+Acc (8) correctly predicts that since DPs must be case-marked, they obligatorily trigger L-drop. But (8) is formulated in a framework that adopts the Case Resistance Princi- ple (Stowell, 1981), which bans [-WH] clauses from case-marked positions. This incorrectly predicts an asymmetry between WH-clauses and non-wrt-clauses: the for- mer should trigger L-drop and the latter should fail to do so. This expectation is con- founded by the fact that L-drop is opnonal with embedded CPs of both types. The present analysis makes five claims. First (following Pulleyblank), L-drop as syntax-sensitive. Second (following Carstens), it signals case assignment. Third, its apparent optionality with embedded CPs reflects a structural ambiguity: nominalised CPs trigger L-drop, bare CPs don't. Fourth, the fact that polysyllabic L-tone verbs are affected differently from monosyllabic ones reflects independent differences between Genitive and Accusative case assignment. Fifth (following Manfredi, 1995b), a metrical analysis of tone makes possible a null theory of syntactically con- ditioned L-drop. Taken together, these claims require a model of grammar in which syntax and phonology meet directly. 2.2. Try the direct approach If L-drop is a syntax-sensitive case-marking rule, then it entails mapping a syn- tactic representation onto a phonological one. Thus, we must ask which component of the grammar regulates case, and consider how L-drop, as a phonological process, can access this information. In the principles and parameters frameworks, there is general agreement that case is a configurational property: a given DP is associated with a given case if the DP occupies a position relative to some local head; call this a case-relation. Thus, the task is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions 86 R -M D~chame / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 for a case-relation to hold. The solution can be cast in a representational or a deriva- tional model. This paper adopts the representational case theory of Bittner and Hale (1995). Assuming this much, we can ask how a phonological process such as L-drop can access the syntactic structure relevant for case. Consider the model in (9), in which the relation between syntactic and phonolo- gical representations is mediated by phonosyntax. At such a level, syntactic and phonological representations may be understood as holding concurrently, or else per- haps as ordered relative to each other. (9) Direct mapping theory NON-PHONOLOGICAL S-REPRESENTATION PHONOSYNTAX labeled syntactic bracketing of word-level P-representations NON-SYNTACTIC P-REPRESENTATION Indirect mapping theories exclude the architecture in (9), and account for syntax- sensitive P-rules by appealing to a level of representation in which syntactic infor- mation is only partially represented; this corresponds to the adjusted S-representa- tion in (10). The claim is that only syntactic information which is consistent with independently motivated prosodic constraints is available to the phonology. For example, it has been argued that phonology is sensitive to edges, but not to phrasal constituents or to category labels (Nespor and Vogel, 1986; Selkirk, 1986). (10) Indirect mapping theory NON-PHONOLOGICAL S-REPRESENTATION I PROSODICALLY ADJUSTED S-REPRESENTATION(S) [ NON-SYNTACTIC P-REPRESENTATION ] The schemas in (9) and (10) represent strong versions of direct and indirect map- ping. It is also possible to countenance a hybrid theory, as in (ll), where some P- rules result from a direct mapping between syntax and phonology, while other P- rules result from a mediated S-representation. 5 s Such a theory is adopted by Selklrk (1984a: 34), who recognizes the existence of P-rules that are directly determined by S-representations (her S-structure), as well as P-rules that apply to adjusted rep- resentations (her Sn" and Sn"). In Selklrk's model, Focus rules and the Sense Unit Condition require PF to feed back into LF. In a theory where phonology is syntax-sensitive, focus intonation would be read off of overt syntax, and so would automatically have LF consequences. R -M Dgchame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 87 (11) Hybrid theory NON-PHONOLOGICAL S-REPRESENTATION PHONOSYNTAX labeled syntactic bracketing of word-level P-representations PROSODICALLY ADJUSTED S-REPRESENTATION(S) NON-SYNTACTIC P-REPRESENTATION How does L-drop bear on the status of syntax-sensitive P-rules? Following Selkirk (1984a), if a P-rule refers to labeled syntactic bracketing, then it is directly conditioned by S-representation. Recall that both Pulleyblank's and Carstens' ver- sions of L-drop crucially refer to labeled syntactic bracketing, so if they are correct, L-drop motivates a level of phonosyntactic representation. This finding is prima facie consistent with either a strong theory of direct mapping, or with a hybrid the- ory, but not with a strong theory of indirect mapping. Exactly the opposite conclusion is drawn by Hayes (1990), who argues that rules such as YorOb~i L-drop, which seem to be syntax-sensitive, "are actually lexical rules, which precompile allomorphs for insertion in particular phrasal contexts" (Hayes, 1990: 103). This allows him to retain a strong version of indirect mapping, but at the cost of reintroducing syntactic information elsewhere in the grammar. By nature, pre-compiled rules are restricted to a particular diacritic lexical class (Hayes, 1990: 95). Thus, a pre-compilation analysis ~ la Hayes necessarily denies that L- drop is related to other tone processes in Yor0b~i, in particular H-insertion. With this in mind, the next two sections demonstrate that L-drop is irreducibly phonosyntac- tic in nature, requiring a model of grammar where phonology has direct access to syntax. 3. The syntax of L-drop L-drop is obligatory before a DP complement (§3.1), but optional before a CP complement, with a corresponding difference in interpretation (§3.2). The targets of L-drop are surveyed in §3.3. 3.1 DP complements Starting from Carstens' (1987) claim that L-drop is the reflex of Accusative case- marking, a theory of case is introduced and the labeled syntactic bracketing which triggers L-drop is identified (§3.1.1). Confirmation that L-drop applies to labeled syn- tax comes from its sensitivity to both the complement/non-complement distinction (§3.1.2) and to complement type (§3.1.3). 88 R-M Ddchame / Lingua 11l (2001) 81-130 3 1 1 Accusative case-markmg Case can be informally defined as a relation between a head and a dependent, where head corresponds to a morphosyntactlc syntactic head such as V or Infl, and dependent to DP The head is the 'source' of the case feature, e.g. Infl is associated with Nominative, transitive verbs with Accusative. The dependent DP bears a case whose value is determined by the position it occupies in the structure, loosely a DP I'S associated witfi Nominative if it is in tile vicinity offnff (i.e., in subject position). and Accusative ifit is in tile vicinity ofV (i.e., fn object position) Wfien the posi- tion that a DP occupies determines the case that it bears, it is often referred to as 'structural case' (Chomsky, 1981). For concreteness, this paper adopts the theory of Blttner and Hale (1995). Their proposal distinguishes two types of structural case: unmarked and marked, with the former corresponding to a bare DP, and the latter corresponding to a DP contained with a Kase Phrase (KP)J ~ In a Nominative/ Accusative configuration, Nominative is the unmarked structural Case (=DP), while Accusative is the marked structural Case (=DP introduced by KP). Accusative is a feature associated with a K which heads a KP projection between V and DP. Nomi- native, by contrast, is a feature associated with some functional head above VP (for Yorhbfi at least, this seems to be T). K's Accusative feature 1s assigned under lexical head government, while T's Nominative feature is assigned under Specifier-head agreement, cf (12). 7 (12) TP J% DP T T VP [NOMI V KP K DP [ACCl If the labeled bracketing relevant for Accusative case assignment is (13), and if L-drop with verbs is the reflex of Accusative case-marking, then this labeled brack- eting is the descriptive context for L-drop. +' Lamontagne- and T,-a~ ~ ¢ 19~7) dlxo- proW,'~¢ a" KP" sira~-rmx:-, {Tat h',r fi~m-, all" cw;ewrrdrke~ m-g-am~W, are KPs For Blttner and Hale, only 'marked siruclural case" (Ergaiwe.

Some complement~non-complement asymmetries Nominal complements trigger L-drop, nominal adjuncts don't (Aw6btdt~yL 1992b; Aw6yal6, 1997a), cf. (14). There are even minimal pairs where one and the same nominal expression triggers L-drop as an argument but not as an adjunct or adverbial modifier, (15).

Mo ta j~ibu-j~bu. ls sell unimaginable 'I sold unimaginable things' (i.e. everything you can think of) b. Mo ta j~ibu-jabu. ls sell unimaginable 'I sold (my wares) incredibly' (i.e. very successfully) These contrasts show that L-drop Is sensitive to the complement relation. In terms of bracketed strings, a case-marked complement is separated from V by one right- hand bracket (...]v [KP..-), whereas an adjunct is two right-hand brackets away (...]v]vP [NP...). A complement/non-complement asymmetry appears with gerunds too (Abraham, 1958: xili, 306,425). Gerunds are formed by prefixal CV reduplication plus a gram- matical H tone. Relevant here is the surface tone of the verb root. If L-drop occurs, the DP following the gerund is construed as the object/theme of the gerund, (16a). If the lexical L-tone of the verb is pronounced, the DP gets subject/agent construal and Genitwe case, (16b).9 (16) a. [Gbf-gbon iy~,fun n~i~t ktlrb ninfi hpb y)f] sbro.

[[gblgb~55...]] GER-shake GEN car this strike ls LOC.chest 'The car's shaking frightened me' s The Afncamst hterature describes items like piti-piti as ldeophones. They are variously translated into Enghsh as adjectives or adverbs and their syntactic category is a matter of debate (cf Q Stewart, 1998, Aw6yal6, 1998). 9 The vowel of the gerund prefix is z, arguably Yor~b~'s unmarked vowel (Aw6bf~ltlyl, 1978a, Pulley- blank, 1988a, 1998) Gemtlve in Yor~bfi shows up m the form of a M-tone mora, which acqmres seg- mental content from the preceding vowel In (16b), the relevant vowel is [[5]], which Yor~bfi orthogra- phy spells on 90 R -M Dd(halne / Lmgua III (2001) 81-130 The complementarity between L-drop and Genitive case confirms the claim that L- drop requires Accusative case-marking. Moreover, if nomlnahsers freely attach to different layers of a verb projection (Abney, 1987), then the contrasts in (16) can be accounted for in terms of where the gerund attaches. If the gerundive prefix attaches to VP, as in (17a), such a nommalisation has the external syntax of a nominal (Le., it may occur in argument position) but retains the internal syntax of VP In particular, VP nominalisation satisfies the structural condi- tions for L-drop (...]~ [K~. -)- The other possibility IS that the gerundive prefix attaches to V, as in (17b). This type of nominahzation has the external and internal syntax of N. Crucially, since KP is not sister to V, the conditions for Accusative L- drop are not satisfied; instead Genitive is assigned.

NomP gerund VP NomP KP f I V KP gerund V K DP I I I r i I I gb[- gbo, n iy~un ndd gb[- gbOn on mdtC) yi[ shaking the flour.ace shaking GEN tl~e car These &fferences in case assignment correlate with differences in the thematic role assigned to the post-nominal KP. In (17a) KP is construed as a theme (the flour is being shaken), but in (17b) KP is construed as a possessor/agent (the car is doing the shaking). This leads to the following two generalizations for nominahsed L-tone verbs (Manfredi, 1992b, Ddchaine, 1993). First, if a nomlnahsed verb loses its lexl- cal L-tone, it is construed transitively and the post-nominal KP is interpreted as object/theme; this is VP-nomlnalisation. Second, if a nomlnalised verb retains its lexical c-tone, then it is construed intransitively, and the post-nominal KP has a sub- ject/possessor/agent interpretation; this is V-nomlnahsatlon. These complemenffnon-complement asymmetries support the claim that L-drop is the reflex of Accusative case-marking. Nominal complements trigger Accusative L- drop, nominal adjuncts don't. VP-nomlnahsatlon satisfies the structural conditions for Accusative L-drop, V-nominahsatlon does not. 3 1.3 DP-types and the necessary conditions for L-drop Classical case theory (e.g. van Riemsdijk and Williams, 1986: 256; Haegeman, 1991: Ch. 3) divides argument-positions into case-marked and caseless. The predic- tion is that whenever a DP occupies an Accusative case-marked position it should trigger L-drop, but the observed situation is more complex, cf. (18) Cased? P-word? L-drop? (18) a. Overt DP YES YES YES b. Trace of A-bar movement (= WH-trace) YES c. Pronominal clitic YES d. Trace of A-movement (= 'NP-trace') NO e. SubJect PRO NO NO NO ] I NO NO j NO NO NO (n/a) R -M Ddchame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 91 (18) shows that the necessary conditions for L-drop are both syntactic - the trig- ger must occupy a case-marked position - and prosodic - the trigger must be a phonological word. Consider how the contexts in (18) satisfy (or fail to satisfy) these twin conditions. L-drop applies consistently before overt DP's that need case, as illustrated above. This extends to in sttu WH-words, as in an object echo question: (19) a. O ra kfni? [[...r~...]] buy what 'You bought WHAT?' (echo question) b. *O r?a kfni? [[...r~...]] But L-drop fails with A-bar movement (Carstens, 1987: 5; Yfisuf, 1989), e.g. WH- movement, focus-movement and relativisation, (20). The standard view of A-bar chains is that the head is [-case] and the tail is [+case]. This means that an object WH-trace is contained in a KP. Although this configuration satisfies the syntactic condition for L-drop, it fails the prosodic condition: by definition, an empty category like WH-trace is not a phonological word. (20) a. Kfi ni o r~ ti ? what FOC 2S buy 'What did you buy?' b. Isui nl mo r~ ti Ł yam FO¢ ls buy 'Yam is what I bought' c. isu, tf o r~ t~... yam c 2s buy 'the yam that you bought ...' Another context where L-drop fails to apply is with object clitics, (21). Chtics are case-marked argument-type expressions, but they are not phonological words. Since the trigger must be a cased independent word, clitlcs are correctly predicted not to trigger L-drop. (21) ls mi Kb m6 mr. [[...mSmil]] 2s ,e/o Kb m6,6/6. [[...mS~/...m555]] 3s O Kb m6 fin.

Analyses of Romance-type clitics put them m an A-position, and posit successive DP and D movements (Kayne, 1990; Chomsky, 1995; Sportiche, 1998). At first glance, 92 R -M D&hame / Lingua III (2001) 81-130 Yorhbfi chtlcs do not exhibit D-movement effects since they occupy the same linear position as phrasal arguments. Yet many reasons still exist to dlstingmsh them. First, Yor/abfi chtlcs fail standard syntactic tests of independent words (Bfirhgbds6, 1967: Pulleyblank, 1986b: 49; cf Kayne, 1975): they can't be modified, conjoined. focused or topicahsed, while the independent forms permat all these things Second, chtics differ from the corresponding independent pronouns in terms of their prosody, most chtlcs lack inherent tone, whale the independent forms consistently show a LM tonal melody. Further, chtlcs are either V or CV, whale the independent forms have the canonical VCV stem shape of ordinary nouns' (22) ACC CLITICS INDEPENDENT PRONOLNS ls mt b-m1 2s ,e/o, i-wo 3s O 6-un lP wa h-wa 2P yfn ~-ym 3P won h-won i I Representationally, the contrast between independent and chtlc pronouns in Yorhbfi can be reduced to a difference between phrasal and non-phrasal constituents The tonal, segmental and distributional properties of independent forms quahfy them as phrasal As illustrated in (22), the relation between independent pronouns and cor- responding object clltics is transparent: except for the lmtIal vowel, the latter are segmentally identical to the former. The initial vowel of the independent pronouns ts plausibly a Determiner-like position, while the CV component of the pronoun occu- pies a nominal posmon, (23a). ~° Thas is consastent with the fact that noun-initial vowels are vestiges of old noun class prefixes (Welmers, 1973: Stahlke, 1976. Wflhamson, 1976, Akfnkugb6, 1978, Aw6b~ltiy], 1997, S6td6yb, 1997). Suppose then that an object clmc is what it seems: the truncated form of an independent pro- noun. Specifically, an object cllttC is a bare N-head in a D-projection where D lacks content, (23b) l~ Accordingly, the failure of I-drop wath Accusatwe chhcs follows from the fact that they are not phrasal (23) a.

[D Q [,cvl] INDEPENDENT PRONObN ACCUSATIVE CLITIC So far, we have considered A-positions that are case-marked but don't trigger L-drop. wH-traces and clitlcs in object position Next, consider how L-drop interacts with A-positions that are not case-marked If an overt DP must occupy a case-marked m It may be that the outer functional layer is distract from DP, e g Ddchame and Wlltschko (2000) treat Yor/~bfi pronouns as q~Ps, a proJection located between D and N t t The syntax of Accusative cllhcs ~s discussed in more detail below The dlstlnchon between phlasal and non-phrasal pronominal elements recalls Chomsky% (1995 337) distraction between complex and sample pronominal elements respechvely R -M D~chame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 93 position, then a DP that occupies an uncased A-position has to move: this is A- movement (or 'NP movement' cf. Chomsky, 1981; Jaeggli, 1986; Baker et al., 1989). Typical examples occur with verb-forms that fail to assign Accusative case to their internal argument, e.g. passive, middle, unaccusative and rinsing verbs: (24) a. [Dozens of mystery novels] were purchased [top] in Seattle. b. [Three boxes of mystery novels] arrived [tDp ] yesterday. c. [Mystery novels] sell [top] well. d. [Dale] seems [tDp] to like mystery novels. All the examples in (24) have a caseless A-position. In the case theory adopted here Accusative case is a marked structural case requiring a KP-projection, as in (25a). Consequently, a caseless object position will simply consist of a DP, (25b). (25) a .... ]v [KP [oP ...1] b .... ]v 1o.... ] case-marked complement DP caseless complement DP If L-drop requires Accusative KP, then the corresponding A-movement structures in YoNbfi should not be L-drop contexts. Yonabfi lacks passive, and unaccusative diagnostics are equivocal (Carstens, 1986:5 lf.), but clear instances of A-movement exist in the form of object-fronting (Awdyal6, 1997a ). In matrix clauses, this yields a middle construction with an object raised to subject position, (26). In control envi- ronments, the object of the embedded verb raises to some intermediate position, (27). (26) a. Ad6 ta bata. [[...ta...]] sell shoe 'Ad6 sold shoes' b. Bhta~ fi ta t,. shoe NOM sell 'Shoes sold' (27) a. Mo f,6 ,6 ra bath. [[...ra...]] ls want H buy shoe 'I want to buy shoes' b. Mo f,6 batai fi ra ls want shoe H buy 'I want to c.

[[... r~ia]] buy some shoes' bata, rf-ra tj. shoe GER-buy buy shoes' / 'I want shoe-buying to occur' [[...r~ia]] In (26), the DP raises to Spec,TP, where it is assigned Nominative case via Spec- head agreement. The DP-movement in (27) has not been extensively treated in the literature: it minimally involves raising to the specifier of some functional head; 94 R -M Ddchame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 Manfredl (1997) treats ~t as movement to Spec,AspectP. In the present analysis, sup- pressrun of Accusative case correlates with the absence of a KP projection Hence, these structures involve a caseless complement DP which predictably fails to trigger Accusative L-drop. In sum, the claim that L-drop occurs in the context .. ],, [~.. captures the fact that Accusanve KPs trigger L-drop. It also accounts for the possibility of L-drop with nomlnalised VPs: wherever the Accusative case configuration is present, L-drop occurs. The analysis correctly predicts that L-drop will fail to occur if a nominal is not case-marked: nominal adjuncts don't trigger L-drop, nor do caseless DP-traces But as noted by Y~suf (1989), the failure of L-drop with a case-marked WH-trace is not predicted by a purely syntactic analysis, and we have seen that L-drop also fails with object clltlCS, even though they are case-marked. It Is these two contexts that establish that L-drop is determined not just in syntax but m phonosyntax. We can now turn to CP complements 3.2. CP complements Recall that L-drop is optional with CP complements. The CP complements that trigger L-drop are argued to be nominahsed and case-marked, consistent with the claim that L-drop is the reflex of Accusative case-marking (§3.2.1). Independent evi- dence for a link between Accusative L-drop and CP-nominahsahon includes the pos- siblhty of marking clauses with overt Genitive case (§3 2.2). In conjunction with a language-specific ban on embedded WH-clauses, recognizing that L-drop is possible only with nominal complements provides insight Into the pattern of L-drop with embedded clauses headed by b{ (§3.2.3). 3 2 1 Nommahsed CPs are triggers for Accusative L-drop If L-drop marks Accusative case, and if L-drop occurs in the context of an embed- ded clause, this implies the clause is case-marked. If only DP arguments need case, then these case-marked complement CPs are nominahsed Suppose that th~s is the effect of an abstract nomlnaliser, m the form of null D' (28) VP V KP K DP Dxo m CP C TP In other words, embedded clauses are structurally ambiguous between CP and nominahsed CP. If so, we expect to find evidence - independent of L-drop - for DP- R -M D&haine / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 95 syntax in nominalised clauses. Extraction from a nominalised clause - with L-drop - should violate subjacency, since nominallsation adds a boundmg node, but extraction should be possible if the matrix verb keeps its lexical L. 12 This is true: (29) a. ]w6 ni mo m6, p6 a nfl6. book FOC ls know c 1P need 'It's a book that I know we need' b. "]w6 ni mo mo p6 a nfl6. book FOC lS know c 1P need ['It's a book that I know it's a fact that we need'] While L-drop is optional before most CP complements, there are some contexts where it is obligatory. Some representative examples are given in (30). (30) a. N -nf ow6 pfip6, kb {*khn/kan} p6 a se is6 lfle. GER-have money plenty NEG reach c lP do job hard 'You don't necessarily get rich by engaging m hard labour'. (Lit. 'Having plenty of money doesn't require that we work hard') b.

(Lit., 'Doing that requires that we plagiarise') I suggest that L-drop is obligatory whenever a CP complement denotes a state-of- affairs, which ts distinct from both event nominals and propositions (Zucchi, 1993). 14 It seems that if the subject denotes an abstract property, this forces the embedded CP to do the same, which requtres a state-of-affairs nominahsation, which in turn triggers L-drop. This is consistent with the fact that the predicates kdn and gbd normally take an animate subject and select a propositional complement; in such cases L-drop is optional, cf. (4) above for gb~. But when the subject ~s itself a nom- inalisation - as in (30a) n:ni ow6 p@b 'having plenty of money', and (30b) is(yen 'doing that' - the complement denotes a state-of-affairs. Although it is at present unclear what forces this state-of-affairs constural, its correlation with Accusative 12 To my knowledge, Yor~Jb~i does not have a contrast between so-called bridge verbs (e.g. Who did you ~ay left?) and non-bridge verbs e.g (*Who did you whisper left's) See Carstens (1986) for relevant discussion i~ The p~ k{ sequence is a series of two distinct Comps' indicative p~, followed by subjunctive ki See D6chalne (2000) for an analysis based on RlzzFs (1997) exploded Comp, with p~ mstantlatlng a higher 'force' Comp, and k{ a lower 'finiteness' Comp 14 Zucchl's criteria predict the following for Yorl)b~ (1) events should correspond to Gemtlve gerunds, (u) states-otZafl~urs should be reafised by Accusative gerunds and nomlnahsed Cffs, (in) proposltlonai entitles should be CPs and thctlve ctauses "Uais classification may provide a way to distinguish the abstract 'fact' noun posited by Collins (1994) for Gbb from the event nommahser proposed by Manfredi (1997 96f) for Yor~b£ The former should act like a proposmonal entity, the latter like a state-of- affairs. 96 R-~4 Dd~hame / L n q, ua tll (2001) 81-130 L-drop provMes lndtrect support for the claim that Yonhb;i CPs undergo abstract nommahzatmn ~5 3 2 2 Nommahsed CPs with Genmve case By hypothes~s, a nommahsed CP m obJect positron - triggering L-drop - ts marked Accusative.

Mo r~in'tf i [p6 e w~i]. ls remember GEN C 2P come 'What I remembered is that you (pl.) came' The optionahty of Genitive with clausal complements shadows the optlonality of Accusative L-drop. Such case-marked clauses are often translated into English by Yorfib~i speakers with a what-cleft, e.g. (3b) and (4b) for Accusative-marked clauses, and (32c) for Genitive-marked clauses. This is presumably an attempt to render the state-of-affairs construal associated with CP-nominalisatIon. The claim that noml- nalised complement CPs trigger Accusative L-drop also has implications for the analysis of embedded wu-clauses, to which I now turn. 3.2.3. On the impossibility of embedded WH-clauses From examples like (33), Carstens (1988) concludes that L-drop is obligatory with embedded WE-clauses. The picture is more complicated, however. (34) shows that such examples can also be pronounced with L tone on the matrix verb m,b 'know', so L-drop is evidently optional, even there. (33) a. Mo mo [bf 6 ti pa ekfin]. ls know way 3s PV kill leopard 'I know how s/he killed the leopard' (Carstens, 1988) b.

A m6 [bf a ti se nflfitl s6]. 1P know way lp pv do must do.3s 'We know how we must do it' (Abraham, 1958: 104) (< m,b) A second observation is also pertinent: all the examples in (33) and (34) contain b/-clauses. Other than b/-clauses, Yon)b~i lacks embedded WH-clauses as a general 98 R-M D&hame / Lmqua lll (2001) 81-130 matter (Carstens, 1988: 16, fn 3). Presented with an ill-formed embedded wu-clause like (35a), speakers volunteer the relative clause construction m (35b) In the latter, the nominal head of the relahve clause (era "person') triggers L-drop as expected (35) a. *Add mb/mo [ta nl Ktinl6 rf]. know who c see [Add knows who Ktinl6 saw] b. Add mo em tf Kfinld rf. , i know person (' see "Ad6 knows who Ktinld saw' (Lit 'Add knows the person Ktinl6 saw'.) The above points can be assessed together If L-drop apphes before a KP. it is rea- sonable to look for Independent evidence that interrogative b/-clauses which trigger L-drop meet this structural description. The absence of other types of embedded WH- clauses In Yorfibfi suggests that b/-clauses are not [+wn] CPs. But if b/-clauses don't have the structure of wft-clauses, what ~s their structure '~ There are reasons to tbmk that b[ is the nominal head of a relative clause: (36) [,,, b[, [~,, OP, [,~. t, ..]1] Accordingly, b/-clauses that fail to trigger L-drop will be analysed in the same way as nominal adjuncts In both instances, the nominal head is introduced as a VP- adjunct, so L-drop falls: (37) a. Mo m6 [bf 6 tl pa ektm] Is know way 3s pv kill leopard 'I knew (it) as soon as s/he killed the leopard' b. Mo t~ jfibu-jhbu. I s sell ummagmable 'I sold (my wares) incredibly' (1 e. very successfully) And b/-clauses that trigger L-drop will be analysed in the same way as nominal com- plements. Both are in an Accusative configuratlon, so L-drop applies. (38) a Mo mo [bf 6 tl pa ekan] ls know way 3s pv kill leopard 'I know how s/he kdled the leopard" (Carstens, 1988) b Mo ta jfibu-j~bu. ls sell unimaginable 'I sold unimaginable things' (1 e. everything you can think of) In other words, the contrast between (37a) and (38a) reflects the attachment site of the b/-clause' as a VP-adjunct m (37a), as a case-marked complement to V m (38a). R -M D&hame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 99 This is consistent with the interpretive difference between the two examples. Now consider the evidence that bf heads a relative clause. The present analysis concurs with the tra&tional view that bf is a noun meaning 'way, manner' (Abraham, 1958; Aw6bhlfiyi, 1978a; Oy~hir~, 1982a). With respect to its internal syntax, b[ behaves like a noun in its ability to assign Genitive case to a following noun: (39) 13 wf ej6 [bf i aw6wa]. 3s say case way GEN grumbler 'S/he complains like a grumbler' (Oyhl~iran, 1982a: 114) With respect to external syntax, a phrase headed by b[ can stand in the full range of case positions. In subject position, a b/-clause is marked Nominative by the H tone spell-out of null T, (40a). A b/-clause in object position can trigger L-drop, which by hypothesis reqmres Accusative, (40b). A b/-clause is marked Genitive as the com- plement of the locative nominal in~ 'stomach, inside', (40c). Finally, a b/-clause can be a prepositional (Oblique) object of s[ 'to', (40d). (40) a. [BI isu 6 se ta] fi yh mf l',6nu. way yam NOM Pv sell NOM open lS K-mouth 'The way yam sold surprised me' b.

And if b[ is a noun, it can host a relative clause, so b/-clauses predictably trigger L-drop. This contrasts with Carstens' pro- posal that b/-clauses are wn-clauses, which leaves unexplained why b/-clauses differ from all other WH-clauses in YonhNi in that the latter cannot be embedded. What remains to be shown is that the b/-clauses have the internal structure of relative clauses. Yorhb~i relative clauses are head-initial; the head is usually followed by the ele- ment tL Obligatory ti is seen in (41a) with object relativisation. However, a restricted set of head nouns mcluding ~i 'person', ohun 'thing', ,bnd 'way' and igba 'time', allow tf to be suppressed as in (41b), cf. Aw6bhlfiyl (1978a: 36). 100 R -M D& hame / Lingua 11 l (2001) 81-130 (41) a. ajfi, [*(tf) B6sb, ,6 rf t,].. dog REI. NOM see 'the dog that B6s~, saw b. ent, [(ti) B6sb, ,6 rf t,].. person RE[.

The adjunct gap ~s licensed by a preverb, usually tt or se (Carstens, 1986). ~e' Almost all adjunct relatives require t[ as in (42a) Like other adjunct relatives, clauses headed by the manner noun b[ require a preverb: but in a b[ relative, 1[ is ungrammancal, (42b).

Relativisation of both arguments and adjuncts mostly requires the relattve marker t[. (43a,b). AdJunct extractton also needs a pre- verb (43b). A small set of head nouns do not requtre the relattve marker (43c), while the relatlvlsed manner noun b[ "way' actually excludes tt (43d). 17 (43) a. NP, [~, t[ [,~, t, .11 b.

As a noun. b[ can host a relative clause; this is a h#clause Like other nominal expressions, hi may be introduced as an adjunct to VP (and so does not trig- ger L-drop) or as a complement to V (and so triggers L-drop). This closes the dis- cussion of the trtggers of L-drop; now consider the target of the rule. 3 3 Monosyllabic verbs ale the target o[Accusattve L-drop L-drop targets an element that bears L tone If the trigger is an Accusative KP, then only L-tone verbs can be targets Th~s predicts that no other case-asstgnlng head 16 These preverb particles are related to the independent predicates )e 'do' and tt 'from' (Ward, 1952 I091:, 13'-)) /g-'~'~e-' J'~ also iJo-,sd~le- a~ a- pre~erb- wnlr ad]mrct-extracnolr (Ward; 19~2 i09) 17 Ttns accords with AwdbfJlfiy] (1978a 36), who d~stmgmshes three types of relatives according to whether C is obhgatordy filled(most Ns), opnonaily hiled (clauses headed by ~2" "person , ohun "thing" tOi pellod'), ol obhgatorfly null (clauses headed by hi "way') R -M Ddchame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 101 - in particular L-tone stems which assign Genitive case - will be a target for L-drop (§3.3.1). If the context for L-drop is the head-complement configuration ...]v [KP .... this predicts that no other head-complement structure will be a context for L-drop (§3.3.2). Confirmation of these two predictions provides additional evidence that L- drop is a phonosyntactic process that refers to labeled syntactic bracketing. 3.3.1. Genitive L-drop Within a KP analysis, the difference between the case configuration of Accusahve and Genitive reduces to whether or not K is underlyingly empty (Bittner and Hale, 1995: 6f.). A marked structural case such as Accusative is an underlyingly empty K that satisfies the ECP. An inherent case such as Genitive is an underlymgly filled K selected by a governing head. This predicts that Accusative K will be null, while Genitive K will have content. This contrast is borne out in YonSbfi. While Accusative has no overt content, Genitive shows up m the form of a M-tone mora or timing unit: (44) a. ]v [KP [n 9] [DP "''1] Accusative KP b. ]x [KP [K g] [OF "'" ] ] Genitive KP In Yor6b~i, Accusative and Genitive configurations also reflect the prosody and cat- egory of the head. Accusative KP is found with all monosyllabic verbs, (45a). Gen- itive KP is found with all polysyllabic verbs (Oybl~ir~n, 1970; Aw6bfalfiyL 1978a; Elimelech, 1982; Aw6yal6, 1997a), and all nouns, (45b,c). Is (45) a. tJ lv [KP [K Q] [DP ... l ] b.

However, if L-drop marks the presence of KP, then it is expected to occur in all the contexts of (45). In fact, Genitive KPs trigger something akin to L-drop, but it does not have the same propemes as Accusative L-drop. In deliberate speech, before a DP, the overt form of Genitive is an M-tone mora that borrows the segmental content of the preceding vowel. This holds of nouns, all of which assign Genitive case: (46) a. ilO u b~t~i [[]ltJOb~t~ia]] drum/beating GEN [type of drum] 'the bdtd type of drum, playing of bg~td drums' b. p~t~tk) i Timi importance GEN 'Timi's importance' [[kp~tSkiifimi]] Js The preose case configuration of Yor/ab~ denomlnal polysyllaNc (Le.

L-tone stems have a single L-tone autosegment. If Genitive L-drop deleted the L-tone, this would predict the unattested outputs in (49), where all the syllables of the head surface with default M-tone.

This accounts for Its sensitivity to whether the following noun is C-lmtia[ or V'-inltlaL as weir as its sensitivity to tile initial tone of V-initial nouns (Bfiffagbds6, 1966a. 100f.). We have seen Genitive t-drop is optional before a C-initial noun. Before a V-Initial noun, Genitive L-drop is obliga- tory, as long as the lmtlal vowel does not bear L, (50). If the initial vowel bears L, then neither the Genitive mora nor Genitive L-drop occur. Instead. the head noun surfaces with its lexlcal L throughout, (51) 2o ~'~ The- drffeTence be-twee-ct de-aomrrtal- verbs artd V-N compotmds r,; rtor so gweat, strtc-e the ~atter are semanncally noncomposmonal (OyOlfirhn, 1970, Aw6b~10yi, 1978a, Aw6yal6, 1997 lfi) -~ The d~rectlon of vowel ass~mflanon m any gwen instance is determined by vowel quahty, among other condmons (OyOlfirhn, 1970, Bfi~gb6%, 1986, Aw6b~lfiyL 1987.

However, the phonologically condi- tioned behaviour of Genitive L-drop contrasts with the syntactically conditioned behaviour of Accusative L-drop. Accusative L-drop is automatic and obligatory before all overt DP complements, and is insensitive to the prosody of the following DP complement. In contrast to this, the application of Genitive L-drop is determined by phonological context: it is optional before consonant-initial stems, obligatorily before vowel-initial stems that don't begin m L-tone, and ~mpossible before vowel- initial L-initial stems. 3 3.2 Only..]v [Kp... ts a context for L-drop To maintain the claim the Accusative L-drop is sensitive to labeled syntactic bracketing one must also show that no other head-complement structure is a context for L-drop. We have established that Genitive L-drop, which occurs with nouns and polysyllabic verbs, is phonologically conditioned, while Accusative L-drop is syn- tactically conditioned. There are two other case configurations to consider: those headed by prepositions and adjectives. Morphosyntactic prepositions in Yor~bfi are limited to two items: s[ and n[ (Oy~l~r~m, 1989); both bear H tone, so no L-drop con- text arises. As for adjectives, they are scarcer still: all transitive stative predicates in the language are morphosyntactic verbs (Aw6btdtiyl, 1972). A limited set of attribu- tive adjectives exists (Aw6btflfiyL 1978a), but none is transitive so none provides a potential context for L-drop. This exhausts the inventory of lexical heads: only verbs which assign Accusative case trigger L-drop; no other lexical category triggers L- drop. It remains to consider head-complement structures where the head is functional. The relevant F-heads are Tense, Comp, Det and K. The first two form part of the extended projection of V; the last two form part of the extended projection of N (Grimshaw, 1991; Fukui, 1995). Starting with Comp, we see that, in Yor~b~i, all overt subordinating complemen- tisers bear H: pg (indicative), k[ (subjunctive), t[ (relative). And there is also M-tone m, generally analysed as a WH/focus Comp (Aw6bfahiy] 1978b, 1992a; Aw6yal6 1985, 1997b). Since no Yor~bfi Comp bears L, this means they can't be targets for L- drop. Next, consider Tense. Of the elements which occupy Tense in Yol~bfi, only two have final L: kb 'NEG' and y6d 'future'. Neither undergoes L-drop: 104 R -M D&hame / Lingua 111 12001) 81-130 (52) a. K6 1o. i NEG go 'S/he dtdn't go' b. Y66 1o. kUY go "S/he will go' There ts a second set of auxes that occurs between T and VP (Oyblfir'~n, 1982b). Of these, only one has a lexlcal L-tone, namely h ~ 'able'. Here too, L-drop falls to occur: 21 (53) O 16 lo. i 2s able go 'You can go' This exhausts the Inventory of F-heads assocmted wtth the extended projection of V. Now consider the extended projection of N, which tncludes D and K Overt D elements are few, perhaps the only one is the U tone reduplicative prefix of gerunds. 22 And only two overt elements realise K: n "of' and the M tone vowel copy which marks Genitive None of these bears L tone, so none can be the target ol L- drop. 3 4 L-drop syntax A summap3' The preceding has shown that L-drop is triggered by lextcal head-government of an Accusative KP, (54a). This captures the fact that Accusative L-drop occurs before any case-marked lexlcal DP, including those contained wtthin nomlnalised VPs L- drop also applies before CPs that are contained wtthin a nominal structure: thts includes nomlnalised complement CPs (pd- and k/-clauses), and relative clauses (h[- clauses). Accusative L-drop contrasts with Genttwe L-drop in that it ~s syntactically condlttoned, whale ItS Genmve counterpart ts phonologically conditioned, (54b). Confirmation that L-drop is triggered by a case configuration comes from the fact that it fails to apply in contexts where a verb is followed by a constituent that is not a case-marked complement: thts mcludes nominal adjuncts, DP-traces. VP-comple- ments and CP-complements, (54c) That L-drop requires lexlcal head-government is confirmed by its failure to target funchonal heads, (54d). In addition to being syntax- sensitive, L-drop also has an irreducibly phonologtcal character: the Accusative KP 2~ Oy61~iran 11970 193) notes that l~ freely alternates with ld0 (Fit) and le I~), lo m~ knowledge these variants are not syntactically condmoned Before an H tone, y6~) can be pronounced 3'(L but the final i_ Js recoverable from the initial rising tone of the lollowmg word, e g Ydc) 1~d "S/he wdl come" can be pro- nounced [L16w/l~i]] but not *[[j6wfi]] A similar effect occurs with the non-mdlcatwe negator rod& e g Mdd him?

One could state L-drop as a phonological rule with syntactic dia- crincs. This is essentially the view of Hayes (1990), but with the undesirable conse- quence of importing syntax into the lexicon. The alternative is to derive the phonology of L-drop from syntax plus independently needed prosodyŁ Such a result, which would qualify L-drop as a genuine phonosyntactic effect, is the goal of the next sectionŁ 4. The syntax-sensitive phonology of L-drop From a phonological perspective, Yorfib~i has three surface tones, two of which are lexically specified (n and L), and one of which is a default tone (M). From a syn- tactic perspective, one of the lexically specified tones (L) is suppressed in an Accusative configuration; this is L-drop. The possibihty of L-drop raises the question of whether the other lexically specified tone, namely H, is ever suppressed. The answer is no. If this is not accidental, it suggests that H and L do not have equal prosodic status. I begin by reviewing the evidence that Yonhb~i tones show asym- metric behaviour (§4.1). I then argue that L-drop is one way of satisfying the Empty Category Principle (§4.2). 4.1 The tone hierarchy: [ H > L > M } Different tones differ in relative strength or prominence. H is universally stronger than L. Of Yon3bfi's three tones, if M is unmarked (radically underspecified), then it is certainly weaker than L. By transitwity, this gives the following ranking: (55) { H>L>M } (M=~) 106 R -M D&hame / Lingua Ill (2001) 81-130 L and H are cover symbols for feature arrays. I assume Kaye's (1981) theory whereby low is [+L], high ts [+n] and mid is neither. 23 For Yor6b£ mstmmental acoustic observations support the treatment of H and L as positively specified tonal features, while M is unspecified: an unbounded series of n tones has gradual rising pitch, while uninterrupted L tones show gradual pitch decline, but a stretch of '~ tones does not stray from a flat pitch contour (Connell and Lad& 1990: L~infran, 1992). In effect, n and L are active glottal gestures, while M (O) leaves the glottis m a neutral state so far as pitch is concerned. The tone hierarchy in (55) is supported by both phonological and syntactic evi- dence (§4.1.1, §4.1.2). And the asymmetric behaviour of tones can be accounted for by a metrical analysis of tone (§4 1 3). 4 1.l Phonologwal evidencefora tone hterarchy The H > L rankmg is illustrated in Yor6bfi m contexts where H and L compete for a single tone-bearing position (Bfiffagb6,s6, 1970b, Chumbow. 1982). As illustrated in (56), in a vowel sequence where the first vowel bears n-tone and the second vowel bears L-tone, even when the first vowel deletes tts associated H tone is retained, and It IS the L tone which ts suppressed. (56) a. ri+ hp6 'see + bag" b. *r'ap6 [[rhkp6]] c. r~ip6 [[r~kp66]] Yonhbfi M can be dtstinguished from both H and L on the basis of its inertness wtth respect to tone spreading. Both within and across words, Yorthbfi H and L spread automatically onto each other, (57). By contrast, M ls not affected by spreading (58). nor does it spread (59) (57) a HL rf-r?a 'buying' [[rfr~a]] Ow6 wh. 'There is money' [[6w6wfih]] b LH ]we 'book' [[]w66]] Ow6 k6 p6.

Many Kru languages contrast four lex- lcal tone classes (H, "raised' M, M, L), as opposed to three m Yorhbfi 0t, M, i ) and two in most of the rest of Kwa (H, L) R -M D~chame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 107 The inertness of Yor~b~i M can be derived by analyzing it as underspecified (Akin- labf, 1985, 1991; Pulleyblank, 1986a). As tonal autosegments, H and L spread, and are the target of spreading, (60). The absence of an 'M' toneme accounts for its neu- tral behaviour with respect to tone-spreading, (61). (60) a. H L b.

Syntactic evtdence for a tone hierarchy Structuralist tone theory (Welmers, 1959; Voorhoeve, 1961) bequeathed to generative grammar the tonal morpheme - a category whose underlying represen- tation has no phonetic content apart from specification on the tonal tier (Gold- smith, 1973; Williams, 1976). Thesemantic content of such an item is obviously poor, i.e. we never expect to find a language where the word for 'dog' is just a u tone and 'cat' ts simply L. In view of recent phrase structure theory, it is plausi- ble to hypothesise that the tonal morphemes of natural languages belong to the set of closed-class items or functional heads (Fukut, 1995; Hoekstra, 1995). Although few studies of grammatical tone have exploited the theory of functional elements, the descriptive glosses of tonal morphemes in the Niger-Congo litera- ture consistently refer to notions of case, agreement, tense, definiteness and clause type (e.g. Dimmendaal, 1995) - all of which suggest an analysis in these terms. Williams (1976) argues that one should expect massive homophony among tonal morphemes because 'the tonal alphabet' is so small. This predicts that H and L are equally suitable as tonal morphemes, but in fact, in Yor~b~i all grammatical tones are pronounced H; none is pronounced L. Grammatical H tone is a general phenomenon in YorOb~i, occurring in all the major closed-class items of basic phrase structure. 24 When they otherwise lack content, the functional heads C, T, K and D can be spelled out with a high tone: 24 Enlarging the sample to the rest of Kwa and Benue-Congo, grammatical L tone IS far less common than grammatical H This IS especially true if one sets aside tile abstract L tone posited as a diacritic trig- ger of nonautomatic downstep in ,~k~in (J M Stewart, 1965, Schachter and Fromkln, 1968) and Igbo (Hyman, 1976, Wllhamson, 1986, Clark, 1989) 108 R -M Ddchame / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 (62) CP C TP [Q--~H] T VP i [Q--~H] V KP K DP [Q--~H] D .. I i [Q---)H] According to (62) certain empty categories - the functional heads - are active m phonology. Such PF interpretation of syntax is ruled out m an mdtrect mapping the- ory, but direct mapping expects it. One context for n-insertion is embedded infint- twes: after a matrix control verb (wtth any tone) a non-lexlcal H-tone appears (B~gb6s6, 1971, Awdyald, 1974: 338ff., 1983), (63a). Thts infinmval n-tone is analysable as the spell-out of a non-finite Comp. 25 H-insertion also spells out null T (D6chame, 1993): in finite clauses whose tense position is not filled by an auxihary, a non-lexical n-tone appears between the subject DP and the verb, (63b). In the ht- erature this is often referred to as the "high tone syllable'. Recall that the KP analy- sis treats Accusative K as an underlylngly empty K: the spell-out of null K ts a plau- stble source of the H-tone of Accusative chtics (Manfredi, 1992b, 1995a) (63c). Spell-out of null D is arguably attested m the H-tone assocmted wtth prefixal redu- pllcatmn of gerunds (Ddchame, 1993), (63d) (63) a 6 f,~ ~ f;, a~o,.

If the inventory of grammatical tones were based on the inventory of lexical tones, then for a language such as Yor~b~i, which has two lexlcal tones (n and L), this predicts two grammatical tones (H and L). On this view, in addition to the H-insertion contexts catalogued in (63), one expects to find instances of grammatically condi- tioned L-insertion. However, L-insertion is unattested. Instead, from a syntactic per- spective, the L-tone counterpart of H-insertion is L-drop - the suppression of L in lexi- cal categories. 26 Note in this regard that the grammatical H-tone of Accusative clitics which spells out null K is complementary to the environment of Accusative L-drop: (64) a. 0 mb 6n. 3s know 3S.H 'S/he knows him/her/it' b. 0 mo ~w6. i 3s know book 'S/he is hterate' (Lit., 'S/he knows book(s)'.)

Tones are organtsed m metrical feet Direct mapping claims that some phonological effects are determined by syntac- tic structure. A 'null' theory of direct mapping should postulate no mechanisms beyond those needed independently in the phonology and syntax. Paraphrasing Cmque's (1993: 239) comments in this regard for Enghsh phrase and compound stress, the ideal analysis would be one in which no language-specific proviso is 26 Beside Yorfibfi L-drop, L-deletion is widely attested in Niger-Congo, e g ]gbo has many contexts where a lexlcal L tone is not pronounced, but none where lexlcal H suffers the same fate, cf Clark (1989). 110 R -M Dr;¢hame / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 necessary and surface tone can be enttrely determined on the basis of surface syn- tactic constituent structure, gxven the lexmal tone melodtes and general principles of tone mapping To this end, the formal treatment of tone assumed here ~s couched wtthm a general theory of mtonattonal prominence that embraces both "stress' and 'tone' (Bamba, 1992: Llberman. 1995) A metrical analysis of Yorhbfi tone can capture the markedness phenomena reviewed above, specifically the H > L > m rankmg. By means of underspecificatton, autosegmental theory captures the inertness of Yor~hbfi M w~th respect to deletion, msertlon and spreading, but autosegmental theory by ttself does no! predtct the other two basic propemes of Yorflbfi tones: the lnsertabtlity of H (as the spell-out of null functtonal heads) and the suppressabthty of L (m an Accusative configuratton) These asymmetries between H, L and M are, however, ideally suited for metrical analysts: (i) some item (H) Is umquely privileged to hcense a syntagmatlc domain, as a head: (it) another item (L) Is uniquely dispensable from the same point of vtew, (in) a third ttem (M) is mvistble to syntagmatlc processes altogether. An account of these tone asymmetrtes ts given by Manfredl (1992a,c, 1995b), who draws on metrical tone analyses m government phonology (Bamba, 1992), and on instrumental studies of Yorfibfi prosody (Connell and Lad& 1990: Lfinffan, 1992). 2v The mlmmal prosodtc object ts a bmary foot combmmg a strong (,s) and a weak (w) posttton (Llberman, 1975; Llberman and Prince, 1977). In government phonology (Kaye et al.. 1990, Charette, 1991; Hams, 1994), phonologmal domams are configuratlonal, e.g. a foot mstanttates the head-complement relatton, with ,s the governing head, and w the governed complement Notattonally, the head of the foot is dominated by a vemcal hne (Hams, 1994 150)' (66) "~ 3 14' If tones are prosodlcally licensed, (67a), then the government relatton is constrained by prosodic alignment: the most promment tone aligns with s, the least promment tone with w, (67b). Tonal prominence is stipulated by the familiar hierarchj,, (67c) (67) a. Prosodic hcensmg" All tones must be proso&cally licensed. 2s b. Proso&c ahgnment.

Tone hierarchy: H > L > Q~. In a language where prosodic licensing holds of tones, foot structure is built directly on tonal elements rather than on rhymal or syllabic constituents. 3° There is typolo- gical support for this: tone languages typically lack rhymal weight distinctions, or lack polysyllabic morphemes, or both, hence there is no rhymal/syllabic work for metrical structure to perform (Manfredl, 1991: 93f., 1992a). On the same lines, lan- guages with the most lexical tone contrasts (e.g. Mandarin) have less complex words and syllables. Thus, in tone languages, tones intervene in the prosodic licensing of feet and rhymes/timing units (cf. Odden, 1997). Now consider how the well-formed- ness conditions in (67) account for the surface realization of tone in Yor~bd. Prosodic alignment requires that H -- the strongest tone - aligns with s, and that O (phonetic M) - the weakest tone - aligns with w. Thus a HM melody (b(tre 'spinach') and a simple-n melody (pdfild 'stockfish') are both licensed by a single foot, as in (68a,b). A simple-M melody (saworo 'ritual bell') may invoke no prosodic licensing at all, on the assumption that, in isolation, a zero element is invisible to licensing requirements, (68c).31 (68) a. ~ b.

This follows from the locality of the government relation, (69a). ~0 This departs from Qld (1995) and Ql~i-0n6 and Pulleyblank (1998, 2000), who assume rhymal foot projection for Yorflbd ~t By hypothesis, non-isolated M - M in a string containing posmvely specified tones - is integrated into prosodic structure This does not reflect any inherent requirement for prosodic licensing of M, but Is parasitic on the hcensmg of the skeletal x-slot (moralc timing umt) For example, an MLH melody can be resolved as LLH, e g Yor~bd is optionally pronounced [[jb(r)hbh~i]], by footing the initial, tonally unspec- lfied syllable O) a. b.

Manfredt's idea is that automatic spreading of L ~s a smctly local effect occurring within a smgle, branching metrical position. This is consistent with the stronger acoustic profile of a denved LH contour, as compared with derived m. In (71a,b), the dotted hne indicates L-spread.

Even though M is zero in YonhbL a rhyme cannot be pro- nounced unless it is prosodically licensed. This shows that there is a close relation between prosodic licensing of tone and timing units. Central to this analysis Is the claim that tones intervene between rhymes and metrical structure, i.e. tonal strength m tone languages is the counterpart of rhymal/moraic quantity-sensitivity in stress languages. Having introduced the organising principles of a metrical theory of tone, I now show how the effects of L-drop and H-insertion are derived from the interaction of metrical structure (specifically tonal feet) and recoverability conditions on syntactic and phonological representahons. 4.2. ECP effects in syntax, in phonology and tn phonosyntax In both syntax and phonology, null positions are constrained by recoverability. For syntax, this is usually stated in terms of the Empty Category Prmciple (Rizzi, 1990: 87): (73) Syntactw ECP'. A non-pronominal empty category must be properly head-governed 114 R -M Ddchame / Lmgua 1ll (2001) 81-130 The syntactic ECP IS a special case of recoverability: a null position is recoverable under government (cf Harris, 1994' 193). This accords with Lowenstamm's (1987) claim that the Ec'P is relevant to phonology. Conceptually, that empty positions are subject to recoverability in both syntax and phonology is the kind of parallelism that phonosyntax expects. Just as the syntactic ECP determines the distribution of null syntactic categories, the prosodic ECP determines the distribution of null prosodic categories' (74) Prosodtc Ece: A null position must be prosodically governed Not only does phonosyntax predict a parallel between the syntactic and prosodic Ecp, it predicts that empty syntactic positions must sometimes satisfy the prosodic ECP. This section argues that null functional heads m YoriJb~i have this property. I refer to this convergence of syntactic and phonological recoverability as the phonosyntactlc Ecp, (75) Because the phonosyntactlc ECP lS a byproduct of the syn- tactic and prosodic EcP, strtctly speaking, it need not be hsted separately. I do so here for convenience. (75) Phonosyntacttc ECP If a null F-head is not properly head-governed, then it must be proso&cally governed 33 The phonosyntactlc ECP mentions 'null F-heads', rather than 'null heads" or 'null syntactic positions'. This is a byproduct of Independent constraints on the licensing and identification of empty syntactic categories Of the possible null syntactic posi- tions, one may distinguish two classes: empty XPs (phrasal projections) and empty X°s (heads). Empty XPs arise via chain formation, and their content is recoverable in the syntax via antecedent-government (Rlzzl, 1990). As for empty X°s, they arise in one of two ways: via chain formation or they are introduced as such in the structure. In the former case, like XP-chalns, the content of the tail of an X°-chain is recover- able from antecedent-government. What of the empty X°s that are introduced telle quelle? UG countenances two types of X°s, namely lexlcal and functional. If we consider which syntactic head positions are likely to be empty, 1[ is clear that null functional heads are more easily recoverable than null lexlcal heads. All things being equal, one expects null F-heads to be more pervasive than null L-heads. leading to the formulation m (75). The phonosyntactic EC'P has consequences for the analysis of Accusative L-drop as a syntax-sensitive P-rule, as the latter revolves a case configuration wtth a null func- tional head, namely K. More generally, it will be shown that both H-insertion and lo- drop are different ways of satisfying the EcP. ~ For Manfredl (1995a 246), this is plo,sodtc ,~ovelnment a null X °, X a closed-class element, is strong ~f X is both ungoverned and governing R -M D~chame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 115 4.2.1. How H-insertion satisfies the phonosyntactic ece In Yor~b~i, if a null functional head (F-head) is spelled out tonally, the tone is u. That H-insertion correlates with a null F-head suggests ECP activity. By hypothesis, H is a prosodic governor, so tt is reasonable to think that H-insertion satisfies the phonosyntactic ECP by providing a prosodic governor for a null-F head. This effect appears in the surface tone of object clitics, which is sensitive to the lexical tone of the verb. After an H-tone verb the clitic surfaces as M, but after an M or L-tone verb it is pronounced H: (76) a. k6 o build.n 3s 'build it' b. je 6 eat 3S.H 'eat it' c. ra fi buy 3S.H 'buy it' On morphosyntactic grounds, object pronouns are N-clitics, contained in a D-shell (§3.1.3). Syntactically, the H-tone of object clitics is the spell-out of the null K asso- ciated with Accusative case (§4.1.2). If no other factor intervenes, this yields (77a). However, there are reasons to think that N-clitics undergo movement from N to D to K, and that (77b) is the correct structure. (77) a. KP b. KP K DP K DP [9---)8] D NP D K to NP I I I I O N N D [~H] tN Evidence in support of (77b) comes from the linearization of the H-tone associated with the null K position. If the Accusative clitic remained in-situ, then the gramma- tical n tone would linearise before the clitic, yielding ungrammatical (78a), instead of the attested (78b). 34 "~4 In Nominative contexts, by contrast, the grammatical H hneanses to the left of the verb, and is pro- nounced on the final vowel of the subject, 0). The outcome m (I) follows from the absence V-to-T move- ment (D6chaine, 1992).

In a chtm configuration, null K is ungoverned: V does not head-govern K, because ~t does not govern all segments of K (K is a two-segment adjunct). Since null K is not properly head-governed, the phonosyntactlc ECP requires that it be prosodically governed: this is satisfied by H-insertion) s (79) illus- trates the reahsatmn of an object clmc after a H-tone verb. The phonosyntactic ECP is apparently satisfied by the verb's lexlcal H, so pronunciation of the chtic as M fol- lows. For example, a ls clitm m this context is pronounced [[ .. mi]], while a 3s clitlc surfaces as an M tone copy of the verb's vowel: -~ (79) a. ~ b. -~ S HI' S 14' , I I I H Q H Q I I I I X X X X i I I I [, r;] [[[mr ,1 ~o] ~l [, rtl [[O,,1 Q~] [[ rfmil] [[ rill] 'see me' 'see 3s' Now consider what happens after an k-tone verb. L is not a prosodic governor, yet ungoverned null K must be prosodically governed. The only way to satisfy the prosodic ECP is to insert U. In addJtmn, there is automatic spread of L onto H, Deld- mga surface rising tone, (80a). The 3s chtic copies the vowel of the verb. so ~t ~s the copy that hosts the inserted H, yielding a surface rising contour, (80b). ~s in this configuration null D is also lexlcally ungoverned, so n-msemon may also be providing a prosodm governor for D ~' hvthe-followmg-drscu,~slon; l-s ,m-relmeserrts d|ltqre-ch*Jc,~ w(drseg.lrrevgrdlCt)lrim~, as ot~r, ed-t~r3~. which for Accusative objects contnbutes only vowel length R -M D&hame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 117 (80) a. b S W S W L H L H I I X X X X I I I I Iv mol [[[m~ N] QD] ~KI [v moj [[OD] QKI [[mSmi t]] [[m55]] 37 'know me' 'know 3s' After an M-tone verb, i.e. a verb without lexically specified tone, san 'bite', the phonosyntactic ECP predicts that the clitic will surface w~th H, and it does: 38 a.

The 'high tone syllable' of null T is reqmred in finite clauses because T is not properly head-governed, (83b).

We have just seen how this applies to null K for object clitics. It remains to see if L-drop can also be understood as an ECP effect. The relevant forms combine H, M and L-tone verbs with object clitics versus DPs: (84) ObJect clittc Object DP a. rf i 'see 3s' rf g~rf 'see tapioca' b. je ,6 'eat 3s' je g~trf 'eat tapioca' c. r~ fi 'buy 3s' ra g~rf 'buy tapioca' With object DPs, H-insertion is not possible, instead there is L-drop. This poses two questions: (i) what prevents H-insertion before object DPs?; (ii) what forces L-drop? Both answers are syntactically rooted. Consider the structure of an Accusative KP, (85). V properly head-governs null K, so prosodic government is not required, and H-insertion is not necessary: (85) [v-.. [K ®~*H [Dp ... The syntactic ECP accounts for the failure of H-insertion before Accusative KPs. But why is L-drop obligatory in the same context? To answer this, one must consider the three relevant Accusative case configurations: an Accusative KP introduced by an H- tone, an M-tone, and an L-tone verb, as in (86). (86) a. [vH [KP[K~] [OP''" b.[vM [~[XO] [D~''" C. *[V L [KP [K 0] [DP "'" As regards null K, the structures in (86) all satisfy the syntactic ECP: null K is prop- erly head-governed by V. L-drop must therefore be an effect of the prosodic ECP, which requires a null position to be prosodically governed. Thus, while (86a,b) sat- isfy the prosodic ECP, (86C) must fail to satisfy it in some way. It is instructive to consider the relevant metrical structures. With H-tone verbs, the prosodic ECP is auto- matically satisfied, as the H-tone of the verb prosodically governs null K: 120 R -M Ddchame / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 (87) a..~~ b.

This means that M is always prosodically governed. Consequently, following an M-tone verb. null K will be prosodically governed.

Indirect evidence that something hke this is cor- rect comes from the non-occurrence of L-drop w~th wu-trace, to which we now turn. 4.2.3. Why L-drop doesn't apply before a wH-trace In the analysis proposed, Accusative L-drop is an effect of prosodic government. Because L is not a prosodic governor, null K is not governed, making (91a) ill- formed. One way to resolve this is to not link L to metrical structure, yielding (91b). However, when a L-tone verb is followed by a KP that has no phonological content, e.g. a wH-trace, the verb maintains its lexical tone, (91c). (91) a. * ~ b. c.

'deletion convention' that erases syntactic empty categories at the input to phonology. However, this won't work for Yo~b~, since both H-insertion and L-drop crucially depend on the presence of null functional heads. One could stipulate that the deletion convention only applies to empty phrasal expressions, but this would import a syntactic distinction - XP vs. X ° - into the phonology. Another way out is to say that WH-traces are not case-marked (Borer, 1983), so they do not satisfy the context for Accusative L-drop. But language-internal evidence says the contrary. With object extraction, there is no direct evidence that the gapped position is [+case], (92a). But subject and possessor extraction respectively require a Nominative and Gemtive clitic at the extraction site, (92b,c): 122 R -M Dd~hame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 (92) a.

(L~t., 'Who, dtd you buy hts, book?') cf. *Ta, ni t, ra tsu? cf. *Ta, nl o ra iw6 t, ? Moreover, Accusative chtics become obhgatory whenever wH-movement wolates subjacency: (93) Ki nl o mo bf Oj6 ,se je *(,6) ? what Foc 2s know way pv eat 3S.ACC 'What do you know how Oj6 ate it?" Thus, the failure of L-drop with WH-traces is not accounted for by a deletmn con- vennon for empty categories, nor is it accounted for by a stipulation about the case properties of WH-traces. There is a third posslbihty, namely that the failure of L-drop with WH-trace follows from foot structure. By hypothesis, null metrical posttions are licensed only if they are recoverable. In particular, L, as the left adjunct to a strong position, can locally hcense a null posmon. This is precisely what happens ~qth L-tone verbs followed by a wry-trace. In (91c), the L-tone verb constttutes its own metrical foot, and L-drop doesn't occur because there is no null K to prosodically govern. 42 4 3 l~-drop phonology" A summary The possibility of I_-drop, and the absence of H-drop, follow from a metrical analys~s of tone: all tones are prosodically licensed, tonal prominence ~s determined by the hierarchy: H > u > O, with the most prominent tone (14) aligning with s, the weakest (O = M) with w, and L attaching as a left-adjunct to s. A leading idea of the phonosyntacttc analysis proposed here is that both phonological and syntactic repre- sentations respect similar structural conditions regarding the recoverabdtty of null posmons' the syntactic zcp requtres that an empty syntactxc category be properly head-governed; the prosodic ECP requires that a null position be prosodtcalty gov- erned. When these two conditions converge on the same element, this yields phonosyntacttc ECP effects' a null F-head which Is not properly head-governed must 42 One might conclude from this that the context for L-drop Is more accurately stated as ( ], [~. [~ O ) rather than ( ], [~p ) However, since the KP analysis treats Accusanve case as an underlymgly null K, the latter automatically ]mphes the former R -M D~chame / Lmgua 111 (2001) 81-130 123 be prosodically governed. 43 The phonosyntactic ECP accounts for the occurrence and distribution of H-insertion. Finally, Accusative L-drop was also analysed as the effect of phonosyntax: when a properly governed null K lacks a prosodic governor, the lexical tone of the governor is not parsed; this is L-drop. This analysis accords with the general proposal that syntactic null heads obey recoverablhty, e.g. null D-heads in Romance and Germanic (Longobardi, 1994). 44 Understood analogously, the phonosyntactic ECP is one of the mechanisms available in Universal Grammar to satisfy recoverability. These conditions are formulated in a framework in which the government relation is an organizing principle for both syn- tactic and phonological representations. An open question is what determines, for a given language, if the prosodic ECP is active for tone. Speculatively, I would answer that this is the case when prosodic structure links directly to tones. There is the fur- ther question of why null syntactic positions are permitted at all. One possibility is that null positions are never allowed, so languages choose between spelling them out (as in Yorfab~i) or deleting them, i.e. deletion of null elements is a parametric option. On another scenario, null positions would be permitted if they are recoverable, with recoverabtlity defined configurationally: a position may be null ff it is governed. The latter is the view adopted here. 5. Conclusion The conditions under which a lexical tone is suppressed in Yorfab~i, as well as the conditions which determine when a tone is inserted in a functional head, disprove the extreme view that mapping in phrasal phonology is never directly triggered by syn- tax. One way to reconcile this result with Universal Grammar is to claim that part of phonology - specifically, rules of pitch - requires direct mapping between surface syntactic structure and phrasal phonology, while indirect mapping obtains elsewhere (cf. Selkirk, 1986: 400f.). Indeed, many of the clearest examples of direct syntax- phonology mapping involve tone and/or intonation. Chinese languages are contour- tone systems, and tone sandhi in those languages is apparently syntax-sensitive (Chen, 1990; Lin, 1994). Bantu languages are level tone systems, and many of their tone rules have been analysed phonosyntactically (cf. Odden, 1990a,b, 1994, 1995). In effect, this reclassifies pitch as 'syntax' and not 'phonology' - a suggestion which is not unprecedented. For example, Remhart (1997), updating a tradition that 4"~ If the phonological analysis in this paper were framed in Optimality Theory (OT, cf McCarthy and Prince, 1993, 1994), both H-insertion and L-drop would violate Faithfulness constraints H-insertion vlo- fates the constraint banning msertlon ira tone is m the output, then it is also in tile input (DEP-IO(TONE)')" L-drop violates the the constraint banning d-eli~tion, ltoa tone is in tile input, then it is also in the output (MAXqO(TONE)) The fact that L-drop applies only when H-insertion fails indicates that the constraint pro- hlbltlng deletion is more highly ranked than the constraint prohibiting insertion: MAXqO(TONE) ~ >> DEP- IO(TONE) But even an OT analysis needs to state that the contexts where Faithfulness wolatlons arise are syntactic, so phonosyntax remains relevant 44 Longobardfs (1994) analysis is extended to |gbo by D6chaine and Manfredl (1998) 124 R -M Dd(hame / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 includes Jackendoff (1972), holds that, because focus intonation has interpretive effects, semantic interpretation reads both PF (phonology) and LF (syntax). In the present proposal, this would be captured by saying phonosyntax determines seman- tic interpretation. Alternatively, following the sptrIt of Kayne (1994) and Marantz (1995) one could reclassify the 'syntax' of L-drop, namely the head-complement configuratmn, as part of morpho-phonology This is possible to the extent that L-drop has no semantic con- sequences, so the immediate problem would be to find an independent account of the semantic effect of L-drop before clausal complements. If one wanted to nevertheless keep L-drop m the phonology, the most opttmlsttc scenario lS to dispense with labeled syntactic bracketing and claim that the trigger for the rule is a generahsed head-complement configuratton: L-drop occurs at the left edge of any complement XP. Any such attempt to save indirect mapping faces several hurdles. First, there are head-complement structures where a monosyllabic head bears L-tone, but there ts no L-drop, e.g. 1.-tone auxiliary verbs (cf. §3 3.2). Sttpulatmg the target as a lextcal head may manage to exclude these, but at a price which an indirect mapping theory worthy of the name cannot afford. The only open lexlcal classes in Yor/Jbfi are V and N, so restrtctlng the target of L-drop to "lexlcal heads' smuggles syntactic category back into the structural description, hence the indirect alternattve is not so different from what Jt wants to disprove Second, embedded CPs are head-complement structures which undergo t-drop only option- ally Recall that if L-drop does occur the CP is a weak island for extractmn, and con- versely there is no island effect if L doesn't drop. Thts is exactly the reverse of what a generahsed head-complement analysis expects, since fl is obhged to treat the non- L-drop cases as extraposed or adjoined in some way (c) la Carstens). By contrast, the syntactic solution proposed in §3.2, which posits an abstract nommahser in the L-drop cases, pushes more, not less, syntactic categorlal infomaation into the phonol- ogy. Finally, indirect mapping is less economical than the phonosyntacnc account, because the prosodic mechanism of tonal feet (§4 1.3) is needed lndependentl), to handle a wide range of facts about the &strlbutlon and reallsatmn of tone in Yor~bfi and other languages. This last pomt makes any diacritic treatment of L-drop (e.g a precomptlation analysts along the lines of Hayes (1990)) undesirable smce such an approach would fail to capture significant generalisations about the relation of L- drop to H-insertion. Phenomena discussed throughout this paper point to further simplification of the syntax-phonology archttecture. For example, stem shape m Yorfabfi correlates with grammatical category root verbs are canonically monosyllabic CV, while derived verbs are polysyllabic. This has implications for case: monosyllabic verbs assign Accusattve; polysyllabic verbs assign Genitive 4s Pronouns also divide into prosodic 4s The hnk between prosody and category is conhrmed by the behavlour o[ "sphttlng' verbs such as bgl/¢ damage', which are synchromcally opaque the interpretation of bd;l¢ is not reducible to its con- slituent parts bdr 'come into contact with" and j¢ "be equal to" Such verbs assign Accusatwe or Genitive according to whether the nommat complement occurs inside or outside the verb complex (Av, db/flfiyL 1969 Awdyal6, 1996 12) If the oblect of hdtl¢ follow~; the first s)llable (glo~,,,ed ~ ,~'~ I, it trigger,, I -drop R -M Ddchame / Lingua 111 (2001) 81-130 125 classes, with syntactic consequences: VCV pronouns are phrasal, while (C)V pro- nouns are clitics. Taken together, these effects suggest that, in addition to a direct mapping between tonal prosody and syntax, in Yonhb~i there may even be a direct phonology-syntax connection between syllable-based phonology and syntactic repre- sentation. 46 (Dis)confirmation awaits further research. and bears Accusatwe, (1).
