Barlow* Department of Communicative Disorders, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA 92182-1518, USA Received 26 July 2000 Abstract Accounts of English initial consonant sequences suggest that not all sequences are the same. Data from acquisition, speech errors and language games necessitate unusual rules/con- straints on subsyllabic structure to account for C/j/ and /s/C(C) sequences. Acquisition evi- dence supports within- and across-speaker representational differences for these sequences; however, such evidence for adults remains elusive. This study investigates the representation of consonant sequences within and across adult speakers of English. Thirty adults were trained in Pig Latin using words with singletons and true clusters. Generalization to C/j/ and /s/C(C) was then measured. Results suggested differential patterning for consonant sequences within and across speakers based on consistent production patterns and errors. Differences occurred most often with /s/C(C) sequences and even more so for C/j/. orthography also infhtenced production patterns. Results support differential representational structure within and across individual grammars, which is accounted for via constraint-based output-output correspondence between surface and Pig Latin forms. 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction The purpose of this study is to consider adult English speakers™ productions of words in the language game known as Pig Latin in order to determine how sound sequences - that is, word-initial consonant sequences - pattern within an individual speaker™s grammar. Motivation for this study relates to the occurrence of consonant sequences in English that seem to violate rules of sound sequencing that are lan- guage-specific as well as those that are posited as universal across languages. The /s/C(C) sequences, such as /sp-/ as in ‚spoon™, or /skr-/ as in ‚scratch™, as well as C/j/ sequences, as in the word ‚view™ [vju], are noted examples of such problematic sequences (Selkirk, 1982; Davis and Hammond, 1995). Consider the proposed syllable structure in Fig. 1, where consonant clusters are represented as complex (branching) onsets. Ideally, all consonant sequences should be represented in a structurally similar way. Thus, any consonant sequence, such as /pl-/ in ‚plant™, /St-/ in ‚stop™ and /fj-/ in ‚few™, should be mapped onto a syllable tem- plate such as the one shown in Fig. 1. Unfortunately, this simple assumption about English phonological structure runs into several problems. onset nucleus coda p 1 ae n t Fig. 1. Syllable stmcture of the word ‚plant™. Both /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences violate several phonotactic constraints on sylla- ble structure in the English language. First, there is a general constraint against homorganic complex onsets in English, prohibiting clusters such as */pw-/, */fw-/, */tl-/ and */dl-/. Nevertheless, /St-/, /sn-/, /sl-/ (and, in British dialects, /tj-/, /dj-/, /sj/) sequences occur freely. Second, voiced fricative + sonorant sequences are prohibited in English, yet /vj-/ (and, in British dialects, lzj-/) sequences occur. Third, nasals in initial clusters are generally prohibited; yet, /sm-/, /sn-/ and /mj-/ (and, in British dialects, /nj-/) occur. No other obstruent can be followed by /rn/ or /n/; likewise, no glide other than /j/ can follow a nasal. Fourth, three element sequences are generally prohibited, yet sequences such as /&r-l, ispl-I, lskw-I and lstr-I do occur. Only Is/ may occur as the first consonant of three element sequences. Finally, the C/j/ sequences are further limited in that they may only be followed by the vowel ltd. The /s/C(C) sequences are additionally problematic in that they violate a univer- sal property of language referred to as the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP; see, for example, Clements, 1990). The SSP requires that complex onsets rise in sonority towards the nucleus according to a sonority hierarchy such as that in Fig. 2. This means a consonant sequence such as 1~1-1 in the word ‚plant™ is well formed in that /p/ is less sonorous than /l/, which is less sonorous than the following vowel Id. JA. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 669 However, /s/ + stop sequences (as well as three-element sequences) violate the SSP with fulling sonority, since /s/ is more sonorous than stops. stops fricatives nasals liquids iursza least sonorous I most sonorous Fig. 2. Sonority hierarchy of consonants and vowels (adapted from Clements, 1990; Dell and Eldmedlaoui, 1988; Ladefoged, 1993). Because of their unusual patterning in English, /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences are assumed by many to differ from other consonant sequences in their subsyllabic structural representation; that is, they may not comprise a ‚consonant cluster™ per se, but rather some other type of structure. For example, most accounts of /s/C(C) sequences in English (as well as problematic sequences of other languages) assume that the /s/ is not part of a complex onset, but is rather appended or adjoined after syllabification occurs, as in Fig. 3 (Clements, 1990; Davis, 1990, 1992; Giegerich, 1992; Steriade, 1982, 1988).™ This structure avoids violation of English phonotactics and the SSP because the /s/ is outside of the onset - the structure to which all such constraints refer. s‚ P U n Fig. 3. /s/ as an adjunct to the syllable in the word ‚spoon™. An alternative account (e.g. Selkirk, 1982) has assumed that /s/ + stop sequences (in particular) pattern as single units, much like affricates, as in Fig. 4. Both struc- tures in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 would readily allow for the three-element sequences, which constitute an /s/ followed by an allowable stop + sonorant sequence. Many have also acknowledged the rather unusual patterning of the C/j/ sequences in English (Anderson, 1986, 1988; Borowsky, 1984, 1986; Chomsky and Halle, 1968; Clements and Keyser, 1983; Davis and Hammond, 1995; Giegerich, 1992; Halle and Mohanan, 1985; Harris, 1994; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 1986); however, few ™ A similar structure would be posited for syllable final position where /s/ (as well as the morphologi- cal endings /t/ and /d/ under certain accounts) would occupy an adjunct or appendix position outside of the coda (Sherer, 1994). 670 J.A. Barlow f Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 onset nucleus I I ﬁ7 sP U n Fig. 4. /sp/ as a complex segment in the word ‚spoon™. accounts agree about the structure of these sequences. While some assume the C/j/ sequence is a complex onset, such as that shown in Fig. 1, others assume that the /j/ is part of a diphthong as in Fig. 5. onset nucleus coda IAI k j u t Fig. 5. /j/ as part of a complex nucleus in the word ‚cute™. Early accounts of C/j/ sequences assumed that the /j/ is not part of the underlying representation, but is rather derived by a rule of /j/-insertion (Chomsky and Halle, 1968; Halle and Mohanan, 1985). In order to account for differences between words such as ‚food™ [fud] and ‚feud™ [fjud], these accounts posited very abstract and highly undesirable underlying representations, assuming that the uu] in ‚feud™ is underlyingly the high back unrounded vowel /i/, while in ‚food™ the underlying vowel is /II/. This assumption conveniently allows /j/to be inserted before /i/, but not /u/. Then a rule of absolute neutralisation must change /i/ to [u] in order to prevent /i/ from ever surfacing in the English language. An alternative account assumes that the /j/ is present in the underlying represen- tation. Both Borowsky (1986) and Anderson (1988) assume that the /j/ of the C/j/ sequence is initially an on-glide to a diphthong /ju/, but, by rule, moves to the onset position to create a complex onset (the ‚vowel-to-glide rule™). Thus, this account assumes that the /j/ is present underlyingly and is part of both the onset and the nucleus at different levels of representation. If the /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences are indeed structurally different from true clus- ters (at some level of representation), then this should be apparent from external evi- dence. That is, there should be independent evidence that shows that the sequences behave differently. In fact, external evidence has provided additional proof that these sequences do indeed pattern differently. In acquisition, children show differential production pat- terns for /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences as compared to those clusters that do not violate language-specific or cross-linguistic constraints on complex onsets (henceforth, true J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 671 clusters). While true clusters are produced in error, /s/C(C) and/or C/j/ sequences may be produced correctly, and vice versa (e.g. Barlow, 1996a, 1997a, 1999, in press b; Barlow and Dimrsen, 1998; Chin, 1993, 1996). The order in which consonant sequences emerge seems to differ as well. For some children, /s/C(C) are acquired very early relative to true clusters, but for others, they are acquired much later (e.g. Smit, 1993; Smith, 1973; Templin, 1957). Such differences in learning are further supported by descriptive and experimental evidence from children with phonological disorders (e.g. Gierut, 1999; Gierut and Champion, 1999). These studies all con- verge to suggest that different types of consonant sequences in English may have different structural representations in children™s systems. Not only are there differences in production patterns for these clusters within chil- dren™s grammars, there are also differences UC~OSS children™s grammars. That is, one child might show a differential production pattern for /s/C(C) sequences and true clusters, while another child might not. Furthermore, a given child™s representation for a particular cluster may change over time (Barlow, 1997a). This has been further supported by evidence from perceptual tasks that assess children™s segmentation of word-initial consonant sequences (e.g. Barton et al., 1980). Experimental evidence with adult speakers provides further support for the differ- ent representational structure for the /s/C(C) sequences in English. In Treiman et ah™s (1992) experimental study of syllabification of English real words and non- words, subjects syllabified true clusters tautosyllabically; however, /s/C sequences were divided across syllable boundaries, thus supporting a possible adjunct structure as in Fig. 3. Conversely, in an earlier study, Stemberger and Treirnan (1986) did not find a statistically significant difference between the way English speakers treat the /s/C sequences as compared to the true clusters. Taken together, the two studies sug- gest that there may be some variation within and across speakers in terms of how these sequences may be represented. Pierrehumbert and Nair (1995) appealed to novel word games in order to evaluate the structure of the syllable, also paying particular attention to initial consonant sequences. Specifically, they attempted to further test Treiman™s (1983) findings in support of the existence of the onset as a subsyllabic constituent. Treiman™s findings, also based on novel word games, showed a significant tendency for speakers to pre- serve onset clusters, rather than divide them. Pierrehumbert and Nair found similar results, but the findings were not as statistically significant as reported in previous studies. That is, consonant sequences were split rather often. Interestingly, those sequences that were least resistant to splitting were the /St-/ sequences, while /sl-/ and /pl-/ split the most. Again, the behaviour of the /s/ + stop clusters point to their differential representation - this time supporting the complex segment structure as in Fig. 4. The fact that this behaviour was not statistically significant suggests some speaker variation may occur. Additional experimental evidence with adult speech errors considered the struc- tural representation of C/j/ sequences. Shattuck-Hufnagel(l986) attempted to deter- mine if the /j/ patterns with the onset or the nucleus of the syllable in speech errors involving consonant sequences. Results of her study showed evidence of /ju/ func- tioning as an error unit, SUggeStiUg that the /j/ iS more Strongly connected to the 672 J.A. Barlow / Lingua III (2001) 667-696 vowel. In addition, there were no examples of C/j/ as an error unit - the two seg- ments usually were broken up. However, there were examples of/j/ alone as an error unit, whereby it interacted with final consonants of onsets. Errors of this type sug- gest that /j/ is a segment that is separate from the /u/. As far as group patterns are concerned, results of this nature are perplexing. Shattuck-Hufnagel argues that the results support the notion of /j/-insertion. However, the conflicting nature of produc- tion patterns could instead reflect representational differences at an individual level. Davis and Hammond (1995) consider evidence from individual adults™ produc- tions of words in language games to investigate the production patterns of C/j/ sequences. One such game was Pig Latin, which involves the rearranging of sounds in words such that the onset of the beginning of a word is placed at the end of the word followed by the vowel /er/. (An example would be ‚pig™, which is pronounced as [~gpe~], or ‚Latin™, pronounced as [aetmler].) Davis and Hammond determined, based on individual speakers™ productions, that there are two different ‚dialects™ of Pig Latin, one of which (Dialect A) strands the palatal glide at the beginning of the word and moves the word-initial consonant to the end of the word, as in the word ‚cute™ realised as uutker]. This suggests that, at least for this particular dialect, the glide initially is not part of the onset, but rather part of the vowel. However, in the other dialect (Dialect B), ‚cute™ would be pronounced as [&et], which suggests that the /j/ initially is part of the onset (and is deleted as part of phonotactic repair). They attribute these two different dialects not to the difference in structural representation, but rather to a rule ordering difference. Specifically, they assume the vowel-to-glide rule (mentioned previously; Anderson, 1988; Borowsky, 1986) interacts with the Pig Latin rule to yield the different dialects. In Dialect A, the vowel-to-glide rule is ordered after the Pig Latin rule, yielding @ttket] for ‚cute™. In Dialect B, the vowel- to-glide rule is ordered before the Pig Latin rule, yielding [t&et] (following phono- tactic repair). This analysis is unusual because it assumes that rules of the English grammar as it is normally spoken would interact with a rule that relates to a language game; thus, the explanation for individual differences is not very compelling. Fur- thermore, the account does not explain the differential learning patterns exhibited by children, or the differential speech error patterns exhibited by adults. A variety of researchers have appealed to language games to argue for the exis- tence (psychological reality) of phonological units or representational structure, just as Treiman (1983) argued for the existence of the onset. (For a review of such stud- ies, see Bagemihl, 1995.) It is typically very difficult to measure such representa- tional differences by looking at the normal productions of everyday language. How- ever, the use of external evidence from language games can provide some insight into adults™ structural representations that normal language use may not. Thus far, little research has looked at individual differences; instead, group trends or averages are described in attempt to characterize the speakers of a language as homogeneous (cf. Maclagan et al., 1999). Linguistic accounts of fully developed lan- guages generally assume that all speakers of a given language (dialect) share the same grammar. Yet it is quite obvious that such an assumption cannot account for the language variation and historical change that is well documented. Realistically speaking, language evolution occurs much in the way that biological evolution does. J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 673 A child develops with a certain ‚grammatical mutation™, and this mutation gets passed on throughout his or her generation and the next (Halle, 1962). While lin- guists are forever attempting to posit a single grammar for a given language made up of millions of speakers, not enough attention has been given to variation or as-of-yet unexplained asymmetries across individual speakers or even within a given speaker™s grammar. This proposed study intends to bring these asymmetries into the forefront and to provide a possible theoretical explanation to account for them. The goal of the present study was to determine if differential representations for initial consonant sequences occur within and across grammars of adult English speakers through the use of Pig Latin. The focus of the study is on individual differ- ences, rather than group averages, as it is hypothesized that sequences will be repre- sented differently across speakers; however, some group observations will be made with respect to errors. The paper is organized in the following manner: The next sec- tion will discuss methods of the study, where participant characteristics and proce- dures for obtaining the data will be described. Following that, the results will be con- sidered on a case-by-case basis, where individual differences will be compared. The paper will conclude with a possible optima& theoretic account along with direc- tions for future research. 2. Methods 2 .I. Subjects Thirty adult speakers of English from the San Diego community were recruited to participate through newspaper, radio and flyer advertisements. Eleven males and 19 females participated, ranging in age from 18 to 75 years (mean age 43). All partici- pants were paid $5 per hour for up to 2 hours. 2.2. Dialects of Pig Latin A participant™s pre-training ‚dialect™ (derived from Davis and Hammond, 1995) of Pig Latin was determined based on performance on an 80-item generalization probe (see below). This was determined based on the dominant production pattern for true obstruent + sonorant clusters such as /bl-/, /tw-/ and /fr-/ on the probe. Those speak- ers of Dialect A moved only the first segment to the end, as in ‚blue™ [lubes]. Those speakers of Dialect B moved the entire cluster to the end, as in ‚blue™ [ubler]. Sev- eral participants were not very ‚fluent™ in (familiar with) the Pig Latin game; never- theless, the majority showed a tendency towards a particular dialect for 70% or more of the true clusters. The majority of subjects (24/30 or 80%) used Dialect B prior to training. This is unsurprising, as there is a general tendency for speakers to maintain subsyllabic onset structure, rather than to divide consonant clusters (mentioned pre- viously; Pierrehumbert and Nair, 1995; Treiman, 1983). It must be noted that two subjects, Subject 20 and Subject 24, did not fit the 70% criterion for their pre-training productions, showing only 56% and 50% 674 JA. Barlow I Lingua Ill (2001) 667-696 (respectively) correct productions for their classified dialect with the true clusters. That is, they could have been classified as speakers of Dialect A or B based on their production of true clusters. This is suggestive of their unfamiliarity with the lan- guage game. Their pretreatment dialects were therefore based on production patterns for all consonant sequences. Subject 20 used Dialect B correctly 70% of the time, while Subject 24 used Dialect A correctly 58% of the time. Both subjects™ post-train- ing production patterns for true clusters were far more consistent (at 100% and 89%, respectively). 2.3. Procedures An 80-item generalization probe was administered to determine each participant™s pre-training ‚dialect™ of Pig Latin and to establish baseline production patterns. The probe was also administered post-training to measure generalization to untrained words. This probe included randomly ordered words beginning with singletons and all initial consonant sequences of English, including /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences. The probe items were elicited by providing a verbal cue or description without telling the participant what the target word was. For example, the word ‚shoe™ would be elicited by the researcher in the following manner: ‚What am I wearing on my foot? ™ The participants were to respond by saying the word ‚shoe™ in Pig Latin. The same set of cues was used for all subjects. For those subjects who could not determine the target word based on the predetermined cues, additional cues were provided. In some cases, the word was provided to the participant in the following manner: ‚It™s a ‚shoe™. Now say that in Pig Latin™. The probe words and sample data from Subjects 1 and 8 are provided in Appendices A and B. Each participant was trained on a particular dialect of Pig Latin by a graduate research assistant with training in speech-language pathology and linguistics. The research assistant was well versed in Pig Latin and had previously had much experience with working with adults in clinical training situations (although not for Pig Latin!). Participants were exposed to one of two treatment conditions: treatment on the same dialect or treatment on a different dialect. Specifically, some participants who used Dialect A prior to treatment were trained on Dialect A, while others were trained on Dialect B. Likewise, some participants who used Dialect B prior to treatment were trained on Dialect B, while others were trained on Dialect A. The number of subjects exposed to each training condition is shown in Table 1. Table 1 Number of participants exposed to each training condition F™retraining dialect Training dialect Dialect A Dialect B Dialect A 2 4 Dialect B 15 9 J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 675 Training involved a 26-item probe that included singletons and true clusters in random order. Each participant was trained individually on one of the two dialects of Pig Latin until it was mastered. Training involved an imitation phase followed by a spontaneous production phase using the training probe items. During the imitation phase, each participant repeated the research assistant™s model of a target word in the following manner (depending on the dialect being trained): ‚Tree is [ritex]‚, or ‚Tree is [itrer]‚. All participants completed the imitation phase with 85% accuracy or higher, thus requiring only one repetition of each item of the training probe. During the spontaneous phase, each participant was to provide the Pig Latin form of the researcher™s cued word. For example, the researcher would say, ‚tree™, and the participant would respond ‚[riter]™ or ‚[itret]‚, depending on the dialect being trained. Participants produced each training word at least once during the spontaneous phase. The probe was repeated for those who did not achieve a minimum of 85% accuracy during the first trial of the spontaneous phase. Following completion of the spontaneous phase, the generalization probe was once again administered to determine if learning extended to untrained words and untrained sequences. A specific goal was to determine how the /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences would be produced following training. That is, analysis determined if those sequences were produced in such a way that conformed to the dialect that was trained, or if they were produced differently. If participants produced such sequences differently from the true clusters, this would suggest that the speaker represents those clusters as different from the true clusters. No orthographic cues were provided to the participants during any of the testing or training sessions; however, it will be shown that orthography nevertheless influ- enced several participants™ production patterns. 2.4. Recording and transcription All sessions were recorded in a quiet environment on the San Diego State Uni- versity campus using a Marantz PMD430 Pro portable cassette recorder, an Audio- Technica ATR35S Electret condenser omni lavalier mic and Maxell LXII-90 high bias tapes. The research assistant, trained in narrow phonetic transcription using the International Phonetic Alphabet, transcribed all productions. Trained independent judges retranscribed the pre-training speech samples. Interjudge transcription relia- bility across all data averaged 96%. 2.5 . Analysis procedures All pre- and post-training productions by each participant were analysed for par- ticular patterns. Those sequences that conformed to the established dialect were compared with those that were produced in error. ‚Error™ is defined here as any devi- ation from the predominant dialect pattern (either the pre-training dialect, or the training dialect). Thus, if a participant used Dialect A for a majority of forms, but produced a particular word in the manner of Dialect B, that was counted as an error. Likewise, if the word was produced in such a way that initial segments of the target 676 JA. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 word were altered or absent, those productions were also counted as errors. For example, the word ‚blue™ produced as either [ube~] or [lu?er] would be counted as an error.2 For Dialect A, a correct production occurred with /s/CC sequences when only the first segment moved, as in ‚scratch™ as [kra$ser] but not with [raetJsker]. For Dialect B, production of /s/CC sequences was judged correct when all three segments moved, as in ‚scratch™ as [aetJskrer]. For Dialect B, C/j/ sequences could be correctly produced in one of two ways. Both segments could be moved, as in ‚cute™ as [utkjer]. Alternatively, both segments could be moved and the /j/ could be omitted, as in ‚cute™ as [utker]. This latter production was accepted as correct for Dialect B because it reflects a repair pattern that allows the resulting form to conform to phonotactics of the English language (recall, C/j/ can only be followed by /u/ tautosyllabically). The production of ‚cute™ as [utker] (for example) was not accepted as correct for Dialect A. Finally, production patterns that were potentially related to spelling were also counted as errors and were included as part of a separate analysis. Specifically, some participants altered a word based on orthographic, rather than phonemic, representa- tions, as in ‚shoe™ as [huser]. 3. Results 3.1. Individual differences The primary goal of the study was to determine if there were any differences between adult speakers in terms of how they produce particularly problematic con- sonant sequences. It was hypothesized that, based on previous research, adults would differ from one another in the way in which /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences would pat- tern in comparison to true clusters. Results support the hypothesis. In Table 2, results from all 30 subjects are provided for comparison. Specifically, percentages indicat- ing how well a speaker conformed to a particular dialect for true clusters, C/j/ sequences and /s/C(C) sequences are shown, In some cases, percentages for specific types of /s/C(C) sequences are provided. Seven of the 30 subjects will now be con- sidered in detail. The first participant to consider is Subject 1, who used Dialect A prior to training, and whose data are provided in Appendix A. In keeping with patterns of Dialect A, he split true clusters whereby ‚blue™ was produced as [lubes]. This pattern was evi- dent from 89% of his productions for true clusters, 84% of his productions for /s/C(C) sequences and 100% of his C/j/ sequences. Thus, Subject 1 produced all con- sonant sequences in a similar manner, suggesting that his grammar did not differen- tiate between the different sequences. Subject 1 was given further training on Dialect A, and exhibited similarly stable production patterns: 89% accuracy for true clusters, * Forms were occasionally produced in the plural, which was not considered an error. See, for exam- ple, Subject 8™s data in the Appendix, where the word ‚boot™ is produced as [utsbeI]. Table 2 J.A.

Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 679 72% for /s/C(C) sequences and 100% for C/j/ sequences. Despite Subject l™s general conformity to Dialect A for all cluster types, his productions for /s/ + nasal sequences were particularly notable. Prior to training, these sequences conformed to Dialect A only 25% of the time. Following training, they improved to 50%. These percentages accounted for the slightly lower patterns of production for the /s/C(C) sequences overall. The majority of Subject l™s errors across both points in time relate to the addition or deletion of segments, rather than the use of Dialect B pro- duction patterns. Subject 8™s data are provided in Appendix B. Subject 8 also used Dialect A in her pre-training Pig Latin productions. This was evident from 94% of her true clusters. C/j/ sequences were slightly less stable, produced appropriate to the dialect 86% of the time. Interestingly, /s/C(C) sequences were produced dialect appropriately only 56% of the time. Some of the /s/C(C) sequences were produced in a pattern more consistent with Dialect B, and some were produced such that the /s/ and following stop moved to the end. Both production patterns suggest the segments in /s/C(C) sequences were more resistant to separation than those of true clusters. Perhaps, then, /s/C(C) sequences are represented as structurally different from the true clus- ters for Subject 8. This different representational structure could in turn explain the higher number of errors associated with the /s/C(C) sequences. Subject 8 was trained on Dialect B, such that ‚blue™ would be produced as [ublet]. She was able to master the dialect just as well as her pre-training dialect, at least in terms of her productions of true clusters, with 94% of those sequences con- forming to Dialect B. This time, /s/C(C) sequences patterned with Dialect B 88% of the time. As is evident from the data, the 12% of productions that were not ‚correct™ were due to segmental, as opposed to dialect, errors. Interestingly, C/j/ forms did not follow the change in pattern of production. Only 29% of those forms were pro- duced in the Dialect B pattern; all others were produced with the Dialect A pattern. Again, this reflects a certain resistance to separation of the /j/ and the following /u/ elements, suggesting that the /ju/ sequence may form a diphthong in Subject 8™s grammar. Subject 9 showed Dialect B production patterns prior to training. This was evident from 94% of his true clusters and 96% of his /s/C(C) sequences. C/j/ sequences, however, only conformed to the pattern with 7% accuracy. All of the production errors for C/j/ sequences conformed to the Dialect A pattern instead. Subject 9 was trained further on Dialect B, and showed 94% accuracy again for the true clusters and 100% accuracy on /s/C(C) sequences. C/j/ sequences did not conform to the pat- tern even once (0% accuracy). As with Subject 8, Subject 9™s productions are con- sistent with the /ju/ sequence functioning as a diphthong. Subject 14 used Dialect B prior to training. This was evident from 78% of his pro- ductions on true clusters, 71% of his productions for C/j/ sequences and 84% of his productions of /s/C(C) sequences. Those forms that were produced in error were pro- duced with the Dialect A pattern. Like Subject 9, Subject 14 also received further training on Dialect B, which stabilized productions of all types of consonant sequences. True clusters and /s/C(C) sequences were produced with 100% accuracy, while C/j/ sequences were produced with 86% accuracy. Subject 14 displayed 680 J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 production patterns that would suggest that all consonant sequences pattern as true clusters in his grammar. Subject 18 showed production patterns consistent with Dialect B prior to training. This was evident from 89% of his productions for true clusters and 92% of his /s/C(C) sequences. C/j/ sequences, however, were correct only 7% of the time, reflecting a diphthongal representation of /ju/. Subject 18 was trained on Dialect A. This pattern was stabilized with the true clusters 72% of the time. The /s/C(C) sequences were resistant to the dialect change, however, and only 60% of those forms were produced correctly following training. This was due in particular to the three-element /s/CC sequences, which were produced correctly only 30% of the time. These sequences were produced correctly 90% of the time prior to training (when Subject 18 used Dialect B). Furthermore, /s/ + nasal sequences were produced correctly only 50% of the time (as opposed to 100% prior to training). Not surpris- ingly, C/j/ sequences were now produced correctly 79% of the time, with the dialect pattern allowing the diphthong /ju/ to be maintained as a unit. Subject 21 also used Dialect B prior to training, as evident from 100% of her pro- ductions for true clusters and for /s/C(C) sequences. For the C/j/ sequences, how- ever, only 64% of such sequences conformed to Dialect B. Other C/j/ sequences were produced in a pattern consistent with Dialect A. Like Subject 18, Subject 21 was trained on Dialect A, which was used with 100% accuracy for all true clusters. C/j/ sequences were produced correctly 71% of the time. /s/C(C) sequences, how- ever, were accurate only 64% of the time. Of those sequences, the three-element /s/CC sequences were correct only 10% of the time. When produced in error, the /s/C(C) sequences conformed to Dialect B patterns. Thus, while all consonant sequences generally patterned similarly for Subject 21, the /s/C(C) and C/j/ sequences appeared to be more problematic in terms of application of the pig Latin pattern. To summarize, the subjects of this study were unique in how the consonant sequences patterned in their Pig Latin productions. Some of the subjects™ produc- tions suggested that all consonant sequences patterned in the manner of true clusters. Others™ productions suggested either that /s/C(C) and/or C/j/ sequences patterned in a manner different from that of true clusters or that they were at least more prob- lematic in some way. This then suggests that the subjects may differ in terms of how these consonant sequences are structurally represented in their grammars. 3.2. Group observations While no statistical group measures were calculated, certain trends did emerge from examination of across-speaker production patterns. Specifically, certain conso- nant sequences stood out as more problematic than others for a large number of sub- jects, while other sequences did not. For example, the true clusters generally did not appear to be problematic for any of the subjects, as only 8% of those sequences were produced in error across subjects and across both generalization probe measures. Only two participants (Subjects 20 and 24) showed difficulty with these sequences prior to training. This is attributed to JA. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 681 their lack of experience with the language game, as they did not show such difficulty following training (refer to Methods section). Other sequences appeared to be more problematic across the speakers of the study. For example, C/j/ sequences were pro- duced in error 41% of the time. Interestingly, /s/C(C) sequences were produced in error only 11% of the time across the subjects. Nevertheless, group averages are not useful for determining individual differences in representational structure, and they only serve to obscure any such differences that may occur between two individual jpllUll~S. Perhaps a more enlightening perspective on group trends that still allows for observation of individual differences would be evident from Table 3. Here the indi- vidual cluster types are divided according to the number of subjects who had diffi- culty with them. ‚Difficulty™ is referred to here in terms of the number of times a cluster was produced in error more than 50% of the time for either pre- or post-train- ing measures. Thus, true clusters were produced in error more than 50% of the time for one subject (Subject 24, mentioned previously). C/j/ sequences, on the other hand, were produced in error more than 50% of the time for 18 different subjects. Interestingly, /s/C(C) sequences as a group were problematic for only two subjects. However, upon examination of the individual types of /s/ sequences, it is apparent that the three-element sequences were problematic for eight different subjects. Table 3 Number of subjects exhibiting < 50% accuracy for each cluster type Cluster type No. subjects True clusters 1 subject C/j/ sequences 18 subjects /s/C(C) sequences 2 subjects Is/ + approx sequences 2 subjects /sl+ nasal sequences 4 subjects Is/ + stop sequences 2 subjects 3-clement sequences 8 subiects Thus, evaluation of group data indicates that subjects showed differential patterns for the C/j/ and /s/C(C) sequences, and this observation was strongest for C/j/ sequences. This suggests that, for example, C/j/ sequences may form complex onsets for some speakers; for other speakers, the /ju/ may pattern as a diphthong. Although the group results are not as strong for the /s/C(C) sequences, there is still some indi- cation of differential patterning of these sequences between the speakers. We now turn to a possible confound of these assumptions, namely orthography. 3.3. Spelling injluenced patterns Despite the fact that no orthographic cues were provided to the participants of the study, a particular set of consonant sequences and consonant singletons in the generalization probe were especially prone to spelling-influenced errors. That is, 682 J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 some productions that did not conform to a particular subjects™ pre- or post-training dialect can be attributed to the subjects™ focus on the letters in the word, rather than the actual phonemes. The particular sounds and sound sequences that were prone to these spelling-influenced differences are provided in (1) below. (1) Examples of words prone to spelling-influenced differences Orthography Phoneme(s) ‚queen™ ‚three™ E;™ ‚thumb™ /e/ ‚shrug™/‚shrub™ ‚shoe™ g-™ ‚chew™ ItsI All C/j/ forms Refer to Table 4. Among the errors for true clusters, subjects (regardless of dialect) most likely produced /kw-/, /Jr-/ and /t3r-/ in error. Across the subjects, /kw-/ was produced in error 40% of the time, /Jr-/ 9% of the time and /0r-/ 22% of the time. (Recall the average error percentage for true clusters was 8s.) Addition- ally, the singletons were generally error free (average 6% across subjects). Those singletons that accounted for the majority of errors were /8/ (18%), /J/ (13%) and /tJ/ (25%), which is attributed to their orthography. These examples each have in com- mon a spelling that includes two graphemes to represent a single phoneme. Accord- ingly, some speakers of Dialect A produced such errors as ‚shoe™ @user], or ‚chew™ [hutser], to conform to dialect patterns. This also contributed to cluster errors, whereby ‚shrub™ was produced as [hrAbser] or [rhbser], also conforming to Dialect A patterns (and even violating English phonotactics in the former case). Spelling influ- enced several subjects in the study, as indicated in (2) below: (2) Number of subjects whose productions were likely influenced by spelling Orthography No. subjects ‚qu-™ 15 subjects ‚ml-_ 10 subjects ‚th-™ 10 subjects ‚sh-™ 7 subjects ‚ch-™ 17 subjects What is most critical, however, is the issue of C/j/ words, which were produced in error 4 1% of the time across dialects and points in time. For these words, there is one grapheme to represent two sounds (although the vowel and ‚w™ graphemes may also play a role), as the words in (3) indicate: J.A. Barlow I Lingua 1 I1 (2001) 667-696 683 (3) C/j/ words prone to spelling-influenced errors Orthography Phoneme(s) ‚puke™ $!;-; ‚bugle™/‚beauty™ - ‚cute™/‚cucumber™ ikju-I ‚few™l™feud™ lfju-I ‚view™ lvjul ‚music™/‚mute™ /mju-/ ‚spew™ hpjul ‚skew™ /&jut Because the /j/ is not represented in the spelling of these words, those subjects who rely on orthography for Pig Latin may ignore the sound during the conversion. Thus, for speakers of Dialect B, where both segments are to be moved, a subject may have come up with ‚music™ + ‚usic-may™, whereby the initial ‚u™ could be pro- nounced either as [u], or as Gu] to conform with words such as ‚usual™. Even more problematic is the fact that speakers of Dialect A who drop the /j/ could be doing so because of either phonotactic repair (as mentioned previously), or because of the very same spelling issues as described for the word ‚music™. Speakers of Dialect A (across pre- and post-training measures) produced words beginning with /tI/, /(jr-/, /J/, /Jr-/ and /tJ/ in error far more than did speakers of Dialect B, as shown in Table 4. This is expected, given that those relying on spelling divided the graphemes ‚th™, ‚sh™, and ‚ch™ to conform to the dialect rule. Dialect A speakers produced C/j/ sequences in error 27% of the time. Dialect B speakers pro- duced C/j/ sequences in error nearly 49% of the time, which can also be attributed to orthography patterns, as discussed above. Both dialect groups showed high numbers of errors associated with ‚qu-™ ikw-1. Table 4 Error percentages possibly related to orthography, according to dialect and overall Dialect 8 P ts 9r- Sr- kw- C/j/ Dialect A 39 30 63 48 15 52 27 Dialect B 5 3 1 5 5 32 49 Overall 18 13 25 22 9 40 41 Despite this important confound of the data and resulting analyses, orthography still cannot account for some of the individual differences that can be noted. Con- sider the following comparison: Subject 13 used Dialect A prior to training, during which time C/j/ sequences were produced in error 86% of the time. Subject 13 also showed errors with ‚thr-‚, ‚th™, ‚sh™, ‚ch™; thus, it is difficult to attribute Subject 13™s C/j/ errors to differential structural representation in her grammar. Compare this with Subject 1, who used Dialect A prior to training. In his productions, C/j/ sequences patterned correctly 100% of the time, while ‚qu-‚, ‚thr-‚, ‚th™, ‚sh™ and ‚ch™ were 684 J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-694 produced in error as a result of orthographical influence. Now consider Subject 30 who used Dialect A following training, and produced singletons /t3/, /J/ and /tJ/ cor- rectly 100% of the time. Additionally, no errors occurred with ‚qu-™ or ‚thr- (how- ever, one error did occur with ‚shr-‚). Despite this general lack of spelling-influenced errors on true clusters and singletons, Subject 30 produced 64% of C/j/ words in error. Recall that C/j/ sequences were not the only problematic sequences in terms of dialect error patterns. /s/C(C) sequences were also problematic, albeit to a lesser extent. These sequences are spelled such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between graphemes and phonemes, as in ‚St-™ for /St-/, ‚scr-™ for /skr-/ and ‚spl-™ for /spl-/. Only ‚squ-™ /skw-/ poses an orthographic problem, and that sequence was not prone to errors any more than the other /s/C(C) sequences were. Consider Table 5. Table 5 Error percentages for /s/CC sequences according to dialect and overall. Dialect spl- spr- str- skr- skw- Dialect A 28 33 22 37 24 Dialect B 12 7 4 16 12 Overall 18 17 11 24 17 Recall that /s/CC sequences were the most problematic among the /s/C(C) sequences, such that eight different subjects showed errors for these sequences more than 50% of the time (Table 3). Percentages for each three-element sequence are provided for each dialect and across all speakers in Table 5. Errors for /skw-/ were not any higher than for other /s/CC sequences; in fact, /&I--/ was produced in error with a higher percentage across both dialect groups. Thus, orthography cannot explain the differences associated with /s/CC sequences. 4. Discussion The study of Pig Latin dialect patterns yielded strong support for differing struc- tural representations within and across speakers for C/j/, and some support for dif- fering structural representations for /s/C(C). Specifically, prior to training, partici- pants of the study differed in terms of their use of Dialect A (movement of first consonant) or Dialect B (movement of entire onset) of Pig Latin. For many speakers, the C/j/ sequences and sometimes the /s/C(C) sequences were produced with the opposite dialect pattern, which suggests differing structural representations for these clusters. Training on a specific dialect either involved reinforcing the same dialect or teaching the opposite dialect. However, training on the opposite dialect did not seem to alter or change the participants™ treatment of these special sequences, which fur- ther supported the notion of differing structural representations. JA. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 685 Orthography played a role in the production patterns for some of the participants, which contributed in part to the differential production patterns. We consider possi- ble directions for future research that might avoid some of the problems we encoun- tered that were related to spelling in the last section. Given that some speakers may represent consonant sequences differently from other sequences, we must consider how this can be accounted for under a formal theoretical framework. How is it that certain consonant sequences can be produced in a way that is phonetically similar, but phonologically different, in normal everyday speech (that is, not in Pig Latin)? Likewise, how is it that these consonant sequences can, at the same time, be produced as phonetically different in language play situations? We now turn to a possible account for this by appealing to an optimality theoretic framework. 4.1. An optima&y theoretic account: Output-output correspondence Optimality theory (henceforth, OT; McCarthy and Prince, 1995; Prince and Smolensky, 1993) has shown to be a particularly powerful theoretical framework in accounting for change over time, whether for acquisition by first or second language learners, or for historical change. In OT, the grammatical variation that exists between languages is attributed to differences in constraint rankings (McCarthy and Prince, 1995; Prince and Smolensky, 1993). Differences in constraint rankings also account for the variation that occurs within and across children™s grammars as they acquire the phonology of the target system (Barlow, 1997a, 1999, in press a; Barlow and Dinnsen, 1998; Bemhardt and Stemberger, 1998; Demuth, 1995,1997; Dinnsen and Barlow, 1998; Dinnsen and McGarrity, 1999; Dimtsen et al., 1999; Dinnsen and O™Connor, 1999; Goad, 1998; Pater, 1997, 1998; Pater and Paradis, 1996). Like- wise, dialectal variation and historical change are accounted for via different con- straint rankings (e.g. Guitart, 1997; Guy, 1997; Jacobs, 1995,1996; Kirchner, 1996; Miyakoshi, 1995; Zubritskaya, 1997). In each of these domains, OT is able to account for grammatical change and variation while maintaining continuity of the grammar. It is generally assumed that language change manifests itself through the speech of children and adolescents (Kerswill, 1996; King, 1969; Kiparsky, 1968; Roberts and Labov, 1995; cf. Drachman, 1976). In acquisition, markedness constraints are assumed to outrank faithfulness constraints in order to yield simplified forms (Demuth, 1995; Gnanadesikan, 1996; Smolensky, 1996). Over time, a child™s gram- mar changes to approximate the target system via a reranking of constraints, whereby higher ranked markedness constraints are demoted below certain faithful- ness constraints. As Turkel(1994) and others assume, the final constraint ranking is achieved when there is no longer a differentiation between alternative constraint rankings in their ability to generate target productions. Therefore, a child™s grammar in its final state may or may not correspond exactly to the ranking of the adult, but the end result is largely the same output. The subtle differences between individual grammars then lead to language variation and historical sound change (Turkel, 1994). Proof of such variation in the present study comes from the different produc- tion patterns for C/j/ and /s/C(C) sequences in Pig Latin. 686 J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 Because the C/j/ sequences showed greater inter- and intraspeaker variation in the present study, these will be considered for OT analysis. For possible constraint- based accounts of variation with respect to the C/j/ and /s/C(C) sequences based on children™s production patterns, refer to Barlow (1996b, 1997a,b, in press a,b) and Barlow and Dinnsen (1998). The account must allow for C/ju/ sequences to pattern as true clusters for one speaker, but as a consonant + diphthong for another speaker. Therefore, two separate grammars will be posited for the two types of speaker. For both grammars, a word such as ‚cute™ would have an input representation as /kjut/ (contrary to accounts that assume /j/-insertion). However, for the former grammar, /j/ must surface as part of the onset (Grammar I), while for the latter, the /j/ must surface as part of the nucleus (Grammar II). To account for the consonant sequence production patterns, constraints relevant to syllable formation (as established elsewhere in the literature, e.g. Prince and Smolensky, 1993) will be appealed to. These markedness constraints relate to the sonority slope of a syllable (in keeping with the sonority sequencing principle), as well as the allowable segmental complexity of a syllable. Refer to the constraints shown in (4): (4) Syllable markedness constraints *M/A: h must not be parsed as a syllable margin (Prince and Smolensky, 1993). *COMPLEX: No complex structure (Prince and Smolensky, 1993). *M/h prohibits any segment 3L from being parsed in a syllable margin (i.e. the onset or the coda). This constraint is ‚exploded™ into more specific constraints to yield a ranking based on the sonority hierarchy as in (5) (adapted from Prince and Smolensky, 1993; cf. Gnanadesikan, 1995):3 (5) Margin Hierarchy: *M/a a: E >> *M/I >> *M/u >> *M/i >> *M/I r >> *M/m n~>>*M/fv8~szJ>>*M/pbtdkg This universal hierarchy would disfavour the parsing of vowels into the onset or the coda. Given the hierarchy and universal ranking, violation of *M/a ae E, for example, would be more serious than a violation of *M/l r, in which case /l/ or /r/ would be the preferred (optimal) onset or coda. Crucial to the present analysis is the interaction of the *M/vowel constraints relative to the *COMPLEX constraint. Thus, the remaining *M constraints will be abbreviated as *M/SONORANT (for liquids and nasals) and *M/OBSTRUENT (for fricatives and stops). For ease of exposition, only *M/X violations in onset position are considered for the present analysis. 3 The vowel /I/ is assumed to be more sonorous than /u/, according to Ladefoged (1993), thus warrant- ing the ranking of *M/I above *M/u. The constraints *M/a ae E will be collapsed in the present account, as their sonority differences are not relevant to the analysis. J_A. Barlow / Lingua 111 (2001) 667-694 687 *COMPLEX prohibits any branching structure within a syllable node. This con- straint is exploded into the more specific constraints *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS, *COM- PLEX-ONSET and *COMPLEX-CODA. The latter two constraints are assumed to be very low-ranked in English, as both complex onsets and complex codas are allowed. It is assumed that there is no universal ranking between *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS and *COM- PLEX-ONSET/*COMPLEX-CODA, as typological analyses of languages of the world indicate that the presence/absence of complex nuclei is unrelated to that of complex onsets and complex codas (Blevins, 1995).4 It is assumed that faithfulness constraints against the insertion, deletion, or feat- ural alteration of segments are present and operating in all grammars. These con- straints are assumed to be very highly ranked in English, as they are expected to be in fully developed systems. Thus, the partial grammar we consider here includes only the markedness constraints in (4). For Grammar I, the constraint ranking in (6) is assumed, while for Grammar II, the ranking in (7) is assumed. The crucial difference between the two grammars relates to the relative ranking of *M/r5 and *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS. For Grammar I, *M/I is ranked above *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS, meaning that the grammar prefers com- plex nuclei to having /I/ in the margin. For Grammar II, *M/I is ranked equally with *M/i u below *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS, revealing the grammar™s preference for /I/ in the margin over complex nuclei.6 (6) Gramrnar I: *M/cl ae E >> *M/I >> *COMP-NUC >> *M/i u >> *M/SON >> *M/OBS (7) Grarrmrar II: *M/a in E >> *COMP-NUC >> *M/I i u >> *WSON >> *M/OBS Tableau 1 illustrates the ranking for Grammar I, while Tableau 2 illustrates the ranking for Grammar II. While the two rankings allow for the different structural representations in C/ju/ sequences such as ‚cute™, both allow true clusters such as /kw-/ in ‚queen™ to surface as complex onsets, and both allow true diphthongs such as /au/ in ‚cow™ to surface as complex nuclei. For Tableau 1 (Grammar I), consider input /kjuti for the word ‚cute™. *M/I ranked over *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS eliminates candidate (a) [k7ut] as a possible output (since /r/ would occur in the onset), leaving candidate (b) lkjiit] as the optimal output, despite its violation of lower ranked *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS. At the same time, the very same grammar allows a different structure to surface for input /kwin/ ‚queen™. Candidate (b) [kWm] is ruled out this time by *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS (since there is no violation of any higher ranked constraints), allowing for candidate (a) [kwin] to 4 However, it is assumed that *COMPLEX-CODA is universally ranked higher than *COMPLEX-ONSET given the typological facts. 5 According to Davis and Hammond™s analysis of C/ju/ sequences that incorporated the vowel-to-glide rule, the /j/ is assumed to correspond to the vowel /I/. 6 Additional phonotactic constraints must be incorporated into the full grammar to prevent C/j/ sequences from surfacing with any vowel other than W tautosyllabically. Likewise, constraints against homorganic onset clusters must also be incorporated. These issues are beyond the scope of the present analysis, which simply attempts to account for inter- and intraspeaker variation. JA. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 688 Tableau 1 Grammar I: /j/ forms part of a diphthong ( *MJaaeE 1 *M/I 1 *COMP-Nut 1 *M/i u 1 *M/SON ) *M/ass 1 a A tie-bar indicates subsyllabic units. b ‚Ihe semivowel that would correspond to the vowel /a/ is likely some type of pharyngeal sound, such as /Y/, which is typically produced more like an approximant than a fricative (its more common classifi- cation) (Ladefoged, 1993). Tableau 2 Grammar II: /i/ forms uart of a comolex onset surface as the optimal form, despite its violation of lower ranked *M/i u. Finally, for input /kau/ ‚cow™, high-ranking *M/a ae E prevents candidate (a) lk%] from surfac- ing, allowing for candidate (b) [kc] to surface, even with its violation of lower ranked *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS. In Tableau 2, since *COMPLEX-NUCLEUS is ranked above both *M/I and *M/i u, a complex nucleus will always be less optimal than a form with the high vowels in the onset. Thus, candidate (a) for both inputs /kjut/ and /kwin/ are most harmonic for Grammar II. On the other hand, *M/o ae E remains ranked above *COMPLEX- NUCLEUS, requiring that /kao/ surface with a diphthong, as with Grammar I, thus yielding candidate (b) [k&l as the optimal output. JA. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 689 Both grammars will yield different output (Base) forms that must correspond with a Pig Latin form under an output-output correspondence account. The correspon- dence of a C/ju/ word and its Pig Latin form may be interpreted in a constraint-based analysis similar to that of Base-Reduplicant (B-R) correspondence (McCarthy and Prince, 1995), or Base-Truncated (B-T) correspondence (Benua, 1995; Pater and Paradis, 1996). For the present analysis, Base-Game correspondence (Barlow, 1997a) is appealed to as represented in the model in Fig. 6. B-G Identity Base _ Game Form I-O Faith I Input Fig. 6. Base-Game correspondence schema (Barlow, 1997a; adapted from Benua, 1995; McCarthy and Prince, 1995). In this model, the grammar determines the optimal output structure for the normal production (the Base) of a word such as ‚cute™. Then the grammar evaluates possible candidate forms for the Pig Latin form via Base-Pig Latin correspondence. If the Base form of ‚cute™ is structured such that /ju/ surfaces as a diphthong as in /kj?rt/ (Grammar I), then the grammar will select as optimal the Pig Latin output that is most faithful to the Base - that is, the one in which only the /k/ moves as in l@lcer]. If the Base form of ‚cute™ is structured such that /kj/ surfaces as an onset as in /KJut/ (Grammar II), then the grammar will select as optimal the Pig Latin output in which the /j/ moves with the /k/ to form [utkjer] (or [utker] following phonotactic repair). See Figs. 7a and 7b.7 B-PL Identity [ kjht ] - [ jut.ker ] I-O Faith I /kbtl Fig. 7a. Base-Pig Latin correspondence schema for Grammar I (Barlow, 1997a). 7 It is assumed that uutker] ultimately surfaces with u] as the onset of the fiit syllable, rather than part of the nucleus, regardless of the Pig Latin dialect. This can be attributed to a high ranking ONSET con- straint (all syllables must have onsets). This is also relevant to /ju/-initial words as they are normally spo- ken in English (such as ‚usual™). The ONSET constraint ensures that such forms surface with /j/ as an onset, rather than as part of a diphthong. Additionally, those Pig Latin speakers of Dialect B who produce ‚cute™ as [utker] (Grammar II) employ a high ranking phonotactic constraint against tautosyllabic [kjet] sequences, making [t&jet] less optimal. 690 J.A. Barlow I Lingua 111 (2001) 667-696 B-PL Identity [ kjut ] c-----) [ ut.ker ] or [ ut.kjer ] I-O Faith I /kjut/ Fig. 7b. Base-Pig Latin correspondence schema for Grammar II (Barlow, 1997a). An account such as this would allow for surface structural representations that are phonetically the same but phonologically different under usual speaking situations. At the same time, the Base-Game correspondence model allows for the differing rep- resentations to become apparent under unusual speaking circumstances - particularly with language play. It is assumed that differences that were made apparent with the use of Pig Latin would also become evident with the use of other language games, as well as speech errors. Such variation has aheady been established from other lin- guistic evidence, such as acquisition data. 4.2. Conclusion and future directions In the evaluation of English as a fully-developed system, we sometimes find dif- ficulty in accounting for ambiguous forms such as the C/j/ and /s/C(C) sequences because the available evidence does not provide for a definitive answer about the underlying or surface structure of such sequences. Appealing to external evidence, such as language games, reveals further evidence regarding the nature and patterning of such sequences. Results of the present study suggested differential patterning for the problematic sequences for some but not all speakers, both in terms of consistent patterns of pro- duction and in terms of errors. For example, many subjects who spoke Dialect A produced C/j/ words in a pattern consistent with Dialect B. Errors occurred propor- tionally more often with C/j/ and /s/C(C) words than with any other sequence; how- ever, C/j/ patterned differently in far more cases than did /s/C(C). orthography influ- enced the production patterns for both sequences and singletons; however, it cannot explain the differential patterning of C/j/ and /s/C(C) in every case. This differential patterning of C/j/ and /s/C(C) sequences in this study and in pre- vious studies lends support to the hypothesis that these sequences are represented differently within and across adult speakers. This in turn suggests that speakers may have different grammars, but these differences are subtle enough that they only sur- face in language games or speech errors. Most theoretical accounts of the English language fail to account for individual differences and instead describe the speakers of the English language as sharing the very same sound system. While variability is recognized in the observation that languages change gradually across speakers and across individual words, it is generally not addressed in most linguistic accounts. Results of the present study, as well as other external evidence, suggest that vari- ability should perhaps be taken more seriously. J.A. Barlow I Lingua III (2001) 667-696 691 Further research into these subtly different grammars is necessary so that, for example, orthographic confounds may be avoided. For example, the two Pig Latin dialects could be trained to preliterate children in order to determine how consonant sequences pattern for that population. An important consideration for such a study stems from research by Barton et al. (1980), who determined that preliterate children tend to treat clusters as single units. Once they begin to learn to read, children tend to treat clusters as two units. Nevertheless, data from preliterate children would aid in determining the structure of C/j/ sequences (for example), which may pattern dif- ferently from other consonant sequences. However, /s/C(C) sequences might not behave any differently from other consonant sequences, as they all would be repre- sented as single units. An alternative study could examine adult English speakers in beginning literacy programs. However, most individuals in such programs already have some basic knowledge of spelling, and therefore would possibly be influenced by the orthography in producing Pig Latin forms. Regardless of the type of study, it is important that individual differences, in addi- tion to group trends, be considered. One speaker™s grammar may treat all consonant sequences as the same, while another™s may treat certain sequences differently. Iden- tifying these individual differences will allow us to better track the course of language change, and will help us to identify the underlying cause for ambiguities in language structures.
