Beyond the interest a comparison between Tagalog and Toba Batak holds for typology, the OT analy- sis proposed for Toba Batak contributes to the ongoing theoretical discussion of constraints and their evaluation. First, Toba Batak requires that several constraints be co-ranked. When constraints are co-ranked, their violations count equally in the evaluation of candidates, as though the co-ranked constraints inhabited the same cell of the OT tableau. Second, an OT analysis which captures the behaviour of the cognate morpheme um in both Tagalog and Toba Batak by simply re-ranking a few constraints compels an approach in which, for the cases examined, the work of NoCoda is performed by the combined activity of the two inde- pendently motivated constraints *Geminate and a CodaCond constraint targeting root nodes. The theoretical interest of this approach is that it suggests that NoCoda, the absolute suppres- sion of phonological content in coda position, could be reconciled with a class of relativised I am grateful to many colleagues whose contributions have enriched this paper.

Cartalyna Napitupulu and D. Pohan, native speakers of Toba Batak, kindly supplied many of the facts cited herein. Thanks to Jody Diamond for connecting me with Ms. Napitupulu. I am grateful to Laura Downing, Chip Gerfen, Craig Melchert, Scott Myers, and Keren Rice for useful discussions of the facts and for their comments on versions of the paper.

Much of the paper was written while I was a Visiting Scholar at Rice University during the spring semester of 1997, and I thank the Linguis- tics Department at Rice for its hospitality. The Toba Batak facts analysed in this paper are discussed in Crowhurst (1998) in regard to their significance for typology, theories of phonology, and language vari- ation. This paper differs from the earlier work in advancing a concrete OT analysis of some of the facts discussed in Crowhurst (1998). * Phone: +1 512 471 1701; Fax: +l 512 471 4340; E-mail: mcrowhurst@mail.utexas.edu 0378-2166/01/$ - see front matter © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Keywords: Constraint ranking; Coda conditions; Toba Batak; Optimality theory I. Introduction An early argument advanced in support of Optimality Theory (OT) was based on the infixing behaviour of the affix um in Tagalog (Blake, 1925; Alejfindro, 1954; French, 1988; Ramos, 1974; Prince and Smolensky (PS), 1993; McCarthy and Prince (MP), 1993a,b). The Tagalog data was prominent in founding work on OT because it made the point effectively that potential outcomes which best satisfy one grammatical requirement may be suppressed to better meet the demands of more highly prioritized constraints. This paper proposes an OT account of a richer set of facts observed with the cognate morpheme urn in Toba Batak, a related Malayo- Polynesian language of Sumatra (Nababan, 1981; Percival, 1981; Crowhurst, 1998). Beyond providing an interesting point of comparison with Tagalog, the Toba Batak case makes two new contributions. First, patterns of coda assimilation observed with urn in Toba Batak suggest that NOCODA, the standard OT constraint prohibiting the occurrence of syllable-final consonants would be better viewed as a member of the COOACOND ('Coda Condition') family of constraints. CodaCond constraints have not been seen as prohibiting codas altogether, but rather as limiting the range of seg- mental contrasts expressed in that position. This account proposes a formal relation- ship between the intuitively connected phenomena of coda avoidance and weaker restrictions on codas. This issue is of general interest insofar as it contributes to dis- cussions of positional neutralization and coda (anti)licensing. A second issue of the- ory-internal interest is that Toba Batak provides a new argument for a relation of crucial non-ranking, or co-ranking, between constraints. 1 From the theory's incep- tion, work in OT has discussed non-ranking in the trivial sense applying to subsets of constraints which cannot be hierarchically ranked because they do not interact. By contrast, in the non-trivial relation of crucial non-ranking (co-ranking) posited here, subsets of constraints which have the potential to interact fail to do so in the usual hierarchical sense. That is, the OT analysis of Toba Batak developed below will be shown to require a set of several constraints, each of which seems to occupy the same position in the phonological constraint hierarchy, yet none of which can be shown to dominate other constraints in the set. Violations of co-ranked constraints count equally in determining optimal outcomes. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. A review of the 'classical' OT analysis of urn infixation in Tagalog is presented in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the dominant pattern of affixation observed with um in Toba Batak. In Section 4 the analysis for Toba Batak is extended to account for the Tagalog facts. Section 5 intro- i Co-ranking was used in an analysis advanced in Crowhurst (1994) and is mentioned as a logical pos- sibility for constraint relations by It6 and Mester (1997). M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 563 duces a distinct, innovative pattern of um affixation in Toba Batak. Together, Sec- tions 3, 4, and 5 present a picture of an emergent condition on codas in the varieties discussed. Section 6 contains a brief discussion of possible alternative analyses. Concluding remarks are offered in Section 7. 2. Um infixation in Tagalog Descriptions of Tagalog by Blake (1925), Alej~dro (1954), French (1988), and Ramos (1974) reveal that the morpheme um, variably glossed as 'pf. actor trigger' (MP, 1993a,b) and 'modal' (Blake, 1925) surfaces as a prefix before vowel (V) initial stems (e.g. um-abot), but as an infix with consonant (C) initial stems (e.g. t-um-awag). Representative examples appear in (1). Especially worthy of note is the form gr-ura- adwet in (lb), which shows that with C-initial stems, um appears after an initial string of Cs, not merely after the first one (French, 1988).

PS and MP view coda° avoidance in um-affixation as the result of a 'soft', or violable constraint which may be overridden by the requirements of more highly prioritized constraints in the phonological grammar, and which in turn, may cause constraints with even lower priorities to be ignored. PS's (1993) proposal that phonological effects follow from the requirements of violable constraints which are assigned language-specific priori- ties, or hierarchical rankings, is the fundamental concept of the optimality-theoretic framework they introduce. 564 M. Crowhurst / Lingua III (2001) 561-590 MP (1993b) elegantly capture infixation in Tagalog by appealing to two con- straints, AFF~X-UM and NoCODA, stated in (2) and (3) respectively (see also PS 1993: 34). 2 (2) AFFIX-UM: Align ([um]AF, Left, Stem, Left) Affix-um, stated in the Generalized Alignment notation of MP (1993b), is read as "the left edge of every affix um coincides with the left edge of a stem". In other words, um is a prefix, a morpheme which occurs initially within its grammatical domain. Affix-um is evaluated gradiently, with one violation assessed for every seg- ment separating the left edges of the prefix and its base. 3 The condition imposed by NoCoda in (3) (MP, 1993b) straightforwardly requires syllables to be right-aligned with (i.e. end in) vowels: (3) NOCODA: Align (6, Right, V, Right) A violation of NoCoda is assessed for every closed syllable in a potential output form. MP argue that infixation in C-initial stems is a consequence of ranking NoCoda above Affix-um in the phonological grammar of Tagalog. Under this ranking, prox- imity to the left edge of the word required by Affix-urn is sacrificed in order to min- imize NoCoda violations. To see this, consider the tableau in (4), which evaluates potential outputs based on the affixed inputs {urn, kuha} 'get' and {um, gradwet} 'graduate'. 4 2 The constraint Affix-urn posited by MP (1993b: 22) is a refmement of the constraint Edgemost orig- inally proposed by PS (1993: 35). Edgemost was stated as given below. In other respects, the accounts offered by PS and MP are identical. EDGEMOST (tO, E, D): The item tO is situated at the edge E of domain D. 3 I use the terms base and stem interchangeably throughout to refer to the base of affixation. 4 The following conventions are used in this paper. Following MP (1993b), the notation {um, kuha} used to represent inputs indicates that morphemes in the input are unordered. In statements of constraint ranking, a constraint to the left of the symbol ' ~' receives higher priority than the constraint to its right. In tableaux, crucially ranked constraints are separated by a solid vertical line, with the highest-ranking constraint in the left. A fatal constraint violation is followed by ' !', optimal candidates are checked ' ~', and '~' marks nonoccurring forms incorrectly selected as optimal under a false analysis. Shading obscures cells whose contents play no crucial role in determining the relative harmony of a candidate. Syllable boundaries are indicated throughout with periods. M.

Prefixing a VC affix (here um) to a C-initial stem such as kuha or gradwet intro- duces a coda into the representation, yielding the unattested candidates for output status in (4.1c) and (4.2d). Candidate (4.2e), also unattested, shows that moving um after the first C of an initial cluster yields no improvement over plain prefixation with respect to coda-avoidanceŁ However, placing um immediately before the first V of the stem avoids a closed syllable, minimizing the damage to NoCoda; in this case, illustrated by candidates (4.1a) and (4.2a),/rn/is syllabified as an onsetŁ Um never appears further to the right than this as further rightward movement produces addi- tional assaults on Affix-um without improving the output with respect to NoCoda (see the rejected candidates in (4.2b,c)). Infixation with V-initial stems, on the other hand, introduces no more codas than plain prefixation, and moves um inland at the cost of Affix-um violationsŁ In this case, therefore, um remains a prefix. This outcome is illustrated in Tableau (5), which analyzes candidates for the input {um, asim} 'turn sour'.

If coda-avoidance drives infixation in Tagalog, we may well ask why we find any closed syllables at all, as in the surface forms a.sim, u.ma.sim, grad.wet, and gru.mad.wet. In other words, why does Tagalog not employ a strategy such as V 566 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 epenthesis for avoiding unwanted codas? MP's (1996) answer is that epenthesis vio- lates constraints which demand a two-way correspondence between the elements specified in input and output representations. 5 NoCoda is apparently not highly enough ranked in Tagalog to enforce coda avoidance at the cost of correspondence. Thus, codas in the syllables sim, grad, and wet cannot be avoided due to properties of the underlying representations for the morphemes asim and gradwet. A problem with the PS/MP account of Tagalog um is the paucity of evidence motivating NoCoda as the constraint which crucially motivates infixation. In most cases, identical results are achieved if NoCoda is replaced by the constraint ONSET stated in (6) (MP, 1993b). (6) ONSET: Align (o, Left, C, Left) Onset demands that every syllable begin with a C. V-initial syllables, then, incur a penalty. Tableau (7) re-analyses the inputs {um, kuha} and {um, asim} to show that replacing NoCoda with onset in the constraint hierarchy produces no changes in the pattem of constraint violation (cf. (4) and (5)). (7) 9nset ~ Affix-um Candidates la. lb. lc. ld. 2a. 2b. Onset ku.mu.ha *ku.hu.ma *um.ku.ha *!

According to PS and MP, the argument that NoCoda and not Onset drives infixation rests on um's behaviour with the stem gradwet, which begins in a C-cluster. If infix- ation were driven by Onset, infixing um after the initial C would be sufficient to sat- isfy Onset, and Affix-urn would favour the unattested *gum.tad.wet over gru.mad.wet as the optimal candidate. As noted above, only NoCoda requires that um be bumped further to the right. However, the evidence provided by gradwet is slim indeed, not only because of its loan status, but also because it is apparently the 5 MP's theory of correspondence updates PS's original proposal that epenthesis violates constraints in the Fill family which require that every segment in an output representation should be represented in the corresponding input. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 567 only such form available to decide between the competing analyses. 6 However, in Section 3 1 argue that a comparison with the behaviour of cognate um in Toba Batak supports the PS/MP intuition that the correct generalization for Tagalog concerns coda behaviour, though the details of the analysis are more complex than previously understood. 3. Nababan's Toba Batak The behaviour of um in Toba Batak, as reported by Nababan (1981) and Percival (1981), and discussed in Crowhurst (1998), differs substantially from um in Tagalog. The Toba Batak items in (8) reveal an initially familiar pattern: um is infixed before the first V of stems whose initial C is one of/t c k s d d 5 g r 1 h/- that is, neither labial nor nasal. (Um in Toba Batak marks the 'active completive' tense in verbs, indicates a higher or more intense degree of some attribute, and is used in some infinitives.)

When a Toba Batak stem begins with a labial or nasal C, as in (9a,b), um surfaces as a prefix, with/m/fully assimilated to the stem-initial C. 7 6 French (1988), the source which provided gr-um-adwet, contains no further examples of this type. An initial C cluster is crucial for choosing between analyses, but Tagalog does not in general permit onset (or coda) clusters. These surface in only a few loan words. Gradwet's loan status is problematic, because since gradwet already violates Tagalog's phonological norms by permitting an initial cluster, there is no guarantee that it is not also exceptional with respect to um affLxation. 7 The facts cited in this paper concerning the pronunciation of Toba Batak forms with urn were con- fn-med in 1997 with a native speaker, Cartalyna Napitupulu, then a graduate student at Monash Univer- sity. A note about sources: Though Nababan (1981) and Percival (1981) were published relatively recently, both are based on studies done in the 1950's. Nababan's transcriptions are more phonetically explicit than those given by Percival. For this reason, and because Nababan is describing his own native dialect, I consider Nababan (1981) to be the primary source of data for this work, and I take the pattern 568 M.

The important observations are that (i) um surfaces phonologically as a prefix when the stem is V-initial, or when a stem's initial C matches the labial or nasal quality of/m/in um; and, (ii) when um Nababan describes for um to represent a single, internally consistent dialect (his own). Descriptions in both Nababan and Percival indicate that um prefixes to labial-initial forms, and Percival (1981: 31) states clearly that/m] in um assimilates fully to a stem-initial labial stop. Nababan's transcriptions accord with this description, with no exceptions. However, Percival gives mainly morpho-phonemic transcrip- tions which spell 'rap' and 'mb'. Where Percival is phonetically explicit, however, his transcriptions give geminates [pp], [bb], and [mm]. Nababan's description indicates that nasal-initial stems pattern with labial-initial stems, as shown in (9). (An exception is found with the base neao, which may form its urn- stem by infixing, n-um-eao, as an optional alternative to prefixation. Percival is not explicit in regard to the behaviour of um with nasal-initial stems though all of his examples accord with Nababan's descrip- tion.) Um's assimilative behaviour with labials is not restricted to this morpheme, but is a language-wide sandhi, also occurring across word boundaries. Nabalan (1981: 45-59, 57-60) indicates that [mp], [mb] clusters do not occur, except for Imp] in the single loanword lampu. Um's behaviour in assimilating to stem-initial In] and [q] seems to be restricted to the morphological context, as [mn] and [m 0] clusters are attested across word boundaries. 8 Note that syllable-final 'k' in forms like pasak and makmak etc. is phonetically a glottal stop (see Nababan, 1981: 9). My own queries confirm this point. 9 Examples for which the source is given as CN were provided by Cartalyna Napitupuhi (personal email communications, 7-2-1997 and 10-2-1997). M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 569 is prefixed in the output,/m/is invariably the first half of a labial or nasal geminate C. Gemination is achieved either by spreading/rn/to the onset of a syllable domi- nating a stem-initial V, as in (10), or through full assimilation to a following stem- initial C (9). Assimilation to non-labial, oral Cs is not reported for Nababan's dialect. These facts suggest the following generalization: um is optimally parsed as a sylla- ble, but given restrictions on codas, this is possible only when either the labial and/or nasal quality of coda-bound/rn/can be preserved in outputs by co-associating to the onset of a following syllable. The prefixal status of um can expressed by the constraint AFF~X-UM stated earlier in (2). The need for tautosyllabic parsing is seen in the behaviour of um-prefixed V- initial stems in which/rn/is geminated. If um were not subject to tautosyllabic pars- ing, we should expect the Tagalog pattern in which/m/surfaces as a singleton onset. The prosodic constraint on um can be enforced by the constraints ALIGNUML and ALIGNUMR in (1 la) and (1 lb), which require the left and right edges of the prefix urn, respectively, to be aligned with the same edges of some syllable. I assume AlignUmL and AlignUmR to be contiguously positioned in the constraint hierarchy. Each constraint is evaluated gradiently so that a single violation is assigned when- ever urn-syllable alignment fails. Because urn provides enough segmental content for only one syllable (barring epenthesis), the effect is templatic. To simplify the analy- sis, therefore, AlignUmL and AlignUmR will be collapsed in the composite con- straint UM--6 in (1 lc), which expresses the templatic effect directly. 1° (11) a. ALIGNUML: b. ALIGNUMR: C. UM~6; Align ([Um]AF, L, 6, L) Align ([um]~, R, 6, R) um is the exhaustive content of a syllable. Um--6 in (1 lc) requires not merely that um be tautosyllabic, but that all and only the segments of um be the content of a syllable. This constraint is violated whenever/u/ and/m/are not parsed into the same syllable, or when a syllable contains more than um (e.g. a heteromorphemic onset). However, um-edge alignment may be noncrisp in the sense of It6 and Mester (1994) to allow for gemination. That is, as long as/u/ and/In/are co-syllabified, no violation is incurred if/m/'s root node is doubly affil- iated. Tautosyllabic parsing forces/m/into coda position. Recall that when/m/in um is a coda, it is fully assimilated to a following stem-initial C if there is one, showing that phonological elements in coda position are restricted in this context. Alone, the constraint NoCoda proposed for Tagalog fails to capture this pattern. A more promising solution is grounded in work on coda licensing by It6 (1986, 1989), It6 and Mester (1986), and It6 et al. (1995). These authors have shown that in Japanese, the phonological elements PLACE and [+voice] are normally barred from codas, but may surface there if they are shared by a following syllable-initial C. In these cases, it is association to onset and not to coda position which licenses the relevant ~0 Um=o is closely related to the constraint Affix_<o of MP (1995a), which expresses the crosslinguis- tic tendency for the content of affixes to amount to no more than one syllable. 570 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 contrast. In OT, this generalization is captured with CODACOND constraints which prohibit structures in which a specified element is uniquely dominated in syllable- final position (see Goldsmith (1990) and Yip (1991) for early discussions of coda conditions, and Steriade (1995) for other relevant issues). The full assimilation of /m/in Toba Batak urn to a following C makes a case for extending the CodaCond approach to PLACE and [+voice] (anti)licensing to root nodes as well. 11 In the con- straint CODACOND(ROOT) in (12), the restricted element is a [+consonantal] root node.12 (12) CODACOND(ROOT)" * ~t ]~ I Ł[+cons] (Root tier) CodaCond(Root) (henceforth, CodaCond) prohibits any structure in which a [+cons] root node is uniquely dominated by a syllable-final mora. 13 In simple terms, Cs are not licensed in syllable-final position. I assume with It6, Mester and Padgett (1995) that a singly linked consonantal root node in coda position, as in (13a), violates CodaCond (even if it is part of a place geminate), but that the geminate represented by the doubly affiliated root node in (13b) does not. (13) a. *~ 6 b. ~ 6 I I \ / Ł Ł Ł (Root tier; Ł = [+cons]) The interaction between CodaCond and Um=6 is illustrated by the pattem observed with V-initial stems in (10). Recall that when um is affixed to a V-initial stem,/m/emerges as a coda, but is geminated, providing an onset to the syllable containing the stem-initial V. Gemination is driven by Um~t~, which requires that the segments of um be tautosyllabic, and CodaCond, which prohibits/rn/from being uniquely parsed as a coda. The analysis of the most serious candidates based on the input {um, uli} is given in (14). 11 If only Labial place were unlicensable in coda position, we might expect to find not full geminates, but place-assimilated clusters such as [mp] and [mb]. In fact, [mb] is now a marginal alternative for [bb] for some speakers, though [bb] is preferred (Cartalyna Napitupulu, personal email communication). ~2 Here I adopt the model proposed by McCarthy (1988) in which the feature [consonantal] is built into the root node. The other built-in feature [sonorant] in McCarthy's model does not appear because it is irrelevant. I intend to refer only to the root nodes of nonsyllabic elements in (12) and (13). Feature geo- metric issues are orthogonal to the main points under discussion here. 13 Following the version of syllabic structure advanced in Hayes (1989), the mora in (12) is necessary because the first half of a geminate C is analysed as moraic. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 571 (14) CodaCond : Urn=o ~ Af-~'x-um Candidates CodaCond a. ~ um.mu.li b. *u.mu.li c. *u.lu.mi d. *um.u.li * ! e. *u.um.li * ! The importance of Um~o in the analysis of {um, uli} is underscored by the rejection of *u.mu.li in (14b), the pattern found in Tagalog, in which/m/is uniquely syllabi- fied as an onset. This candidate is excluded because it violates Um=o. (14d), in which um is tautosyllabically parsed but ungeminated violates CodaCond fatally. Only um.mu.li in (14a) satisfies these top-ranked constraints. As Um~o and Coda- Cond do not conflict with inputs based on V-initial stems, it is not yet possible to rank these two constraints directly. The optimal candidate also passes Affix-urn, but this constraint is moot for inputs with V-initial bases: (14c,e) show that candidates violating Affix-um also violate either CodaCond or Um~o (cf. the analysis shown for V-initial Tagalog bases in (5)). Note that as in Tagalog, substituting Onset for CodaCond captures the pattern of um-prefixation found with Toba Batak V-initial stems. However, we will see shortly that Onset does not duplicate the work of Coda- Cond in accounting for um's behaviour with C-initial stems. The next cases to be examined are those in which um concatenates with a C-initial stem. These separate into prefixing and infixing classes. Beginning with the former, recall that when um is prefixed,/m/is completely assimilated to the following stem- initial C, resulting in a geminate. Assimilation is necessary to satisfy CodaCond in (12). Under standard assumptions, geminates have the structure in (13b), in which a single root node is affiliated with two syllables. I propose that in um-pref~ced forms, gemination is the result of a process which fuses the root nodes of/rn/and a follow- ing stem-initial C, as in (15). (For a discussion of fusion, see Sakai, 1995.) (15) FusION: ff I i j \ eij (Root tier) Note that the attested result of fusion applied to an input such as {urn, bege} is ub.be.ge and not *um.me.ge. That is, the features of/b/in bege are preserved under fusion at the cost of those of/rn/in urn, rather than the other way around. 14 This 14 Readers might well ask why a fusion approach has been adopted as opposed to an approach in which the root node of/m/is deleted. There are two reasons. First, this analysis requires/rrd's root node to be present in the output for purposes of urn-syllable alignment. Second, if/m/'s root node were absent in the output, it would be difficult to explain why certain features of/m/(Labial Place or [nasal]) are so tena- ciously preserved. The second issue is discussed immediately below. 572 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 outcome fails to surprise for at least two reasons. First, it is well-known that assimi- lation to Cs in onset positions is unmarked, while assimilation to coda Cs is rare. Sec- ond, it may be that the features of/b/in bege, a root, are preserved at the expense of /m/in urn, an affix, due to the grammatical status of the morphemes containing them. Evidence supporting the second interpretation is found elsewhere in Toba Batak, and should be discussed if only briefly, because it appears to challenge the highly ranked status assigned to CodaCond in this analysis. That is, the prediction of Coda- Cond that only geminate codas are permitted is not surface true. An analysis of medial clusters in Percival (1981 : 17) and Nababan (1981 : 49) reveals that while the presence of geminates is strong, CodaCond is routinely violated by root-internal clusters when the first C is sonorant (e.g. arga, balg6). 15 Note also that root-final Cs may surface word-finally, violating CodaCond (e.g. pdsak, bden, salsal, rahis). Coda-bound/m/in urn, however, respects CodaCond. The generalization seems to be that preserving the segmental properties of roots is more important than CodaCond satisfaction, while the opposite is true when the segmental endowment of affixes is at stake. One possible analysis for this effect appeals to constraints demanding fea- ture identity between input and output representations. The requirement that some feature F present in a representation S 1 be recoverable in a corresponding represen- tation S 2 is expressed by constraints in the IDENT(F) family proposed by MP (1996). The general schema for IDENT(F) constraints is given in (16) (MP 1996: 264). 16 (16) IDENT(F)" Let ~ be a segment in Sl and 13 be any correspondent of cz in $2. If tx is [q(F], then 13 is [~F]. IDENT(F) in (16) states that correspondent segments are identical in feature F. A vio- lation is incurred when no match is established for F. The Ident constraints required to account for the Toba Batak facts impose a correspondence relation between input (I) and output (O) representations, respectively. If different versions of Ident-IO(F) constraints control feature identity for root and affix morphemes, then the different status of roots and affixes with respect to CodaCond can be accounted for under the general schema in (17). ~5 The clearest discussion of cluster patterns is found in Nababan (1981: 45-49). The robust patterns are as follows: Any C may occur as an intervocalic geminate, except */hh/ and /rr/. /11/ is an allophone of/k/which occurs only as a singleton onset. [rr/occurs only once. (Nababan marks/gg/and/cc/as gaps, but/gg/is attested in Percival (1981). It is not clear why Nababan excludes/c/, since/c/occurs only medially in native forms and is always geminated.) The sonorants/r 1 i3/may be followed by most Cs in a cluster (though/ij/generally doesn't combine with voiceless stops, except for/rjk/in loans)./s/ occurs before/p t m n ~L Nababan marks/k/as combining with any following C (except/c/), but on closer examination we fred that pre-consonantal 'k' is phonetically a glottal stop, often reduced from Cs other than/k/(Nababan, 1981: 9). The pattern that emerges is that/s 7 r 1/(i.e. continuams and/2/) are robustly attested as the first C in root-internal clusters. A few other combinations are attested in a single occurrence, often in a loan form. Importantly, Nababan notes than other than as a geminate,/m/clusters with another C only once, in the loan word lampu. 16 The definition of the notion correspondence, mentioned in (16), is as follows: Given two strings $1 and $2, correspondence is a relation R from the elements of St to those of $2. Elements ct~ St and 13~ $2 are referred to as correspondents of one another when tzR~ (MP, 1996: 262). M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 573 (17) IDENT-IO(Fi)-ROOT - CODACOND 7> IDENT-IO(Fj)-ROOT >> IDENT-IO(F)-AFFIX To the extent that CodaCond effects are obscured in root morphemes due to feature identity requirements, Ident-IO(F)-Root stands for the constraints responsible. And, because CodaCond effects are partly obscured in roots under the schema in (17), 17 it is precisely the phonological behaviour of affixes which yields traces of these restrictions in the language. To avoid digressing from the central focus, however, further details of this aspect of the analysis are suppressed. Returning to the discussion of Fusion, optimality-theoretic assumptions require that (15) be viewed as a context-free operation of the generative component, GEN. Moreover, (15) says nothing about the quality of the segment emerging from Fusion. It is therefore significant that effects of (15) surface only when the stem-initial C is either labial (e.g. ub.bd.ge) or nasal (e.g. u¢.~dt.li), or both (e.g. um.rmi.M). The rel- evant generalization is that fusion with the root node of another labial or nasal C makes it possible to recover the labial or nasal quality of/m/. In other words, while certain segmental properties of/rn/, such as [voice], readily converge with the spec- ification of a following C under gemination (cf. up.pS.sak, ub.bLge), it is always the case that either/m/'s nasality or labiality is preserved. In this regard, constraints in the Ident family are useful once again. The specific versions of IDENT(F) required for this analysis demand feature identity between input and output representations, IDENT-IO(LAB)-AFFIX (henceforth IDENT-LAB) in (18a) and IDENT-IO(NAS)-AFFIX (IDENT-NAS) in (18b). (18) a. IDENT-LAB: b. IDENT-NAS: Output correspondents of an input LAB segment are also LAB. Output correspondents of an input [+nasal] segment are also [+nasal]. Equating segmental units with root nodes, Ident-Lab and Ident-Nas are violated whenever a root node specified for LAB or [+nasal] in an input does not correspond to a labial or nasal root node, respectively, in the output. 17 Not all root-internal clusters are assimilated in Toba Batak. Given the consonant inventory [p t c k b dj g s h m n 0 w y 1 r 2] ([2] is an allophone of/k/), the truly robust tautomorphemic word-internal clus- ter patterns can be summarised as follows: Intervocalic geminates are robustly attested for every C except *[hh], [rr], and [ss]. (The geminate [gg] is reported by Percival, 1981 but not by Nababan 1981. The absence of *[hh] is a systematic gap, apparently due to the fact that [h] and [k] were historically in complementary distribution, with [h] occurring as an allophone of/k/only as a singleton in onset posi- tion. On this analysis, a geminate [h] would not be expected. [rr] and [ss] occur only once for Nababan, but [ss] was apparently a robust native geminate which has been replaced by medial ungeminated [c] for modern speakers, according to Nababan (1981: 5-6). This explains why [c], restricted to medial position in native forms, does not occur as a geminate.) True (i.e. nongeminate) clusters are limited to [?] fol- lowed by any consonant except [2 k c w y]; and the sonorants [0 r 1] or [s] followed by a subset of the other consonants, with [r 1] displaying the greatest degree of combinatorial flexibility (see more explicit descriptions in Nababan, 1981; Percival, 1981, summarised in Crowhurst, 1998). In general, non-gemi- nate clusters in which the first C is a noncontinuant obstruent other than [2], do not occur or are mar- ginal, while clusters in which the first C is [2 s ~ I r] are permitted. This means that CodaCond must out- rank some IDENT-IO(F)-RooT constraints, but must be ranked below others, as shown in (17). 574 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 The optimal status of ub.bLge and ug.g6.1i shows that both Ident-Lab or Ident- Nas may be violated to purchase satisfaction for CodaCond. CodaCond must there- fore outrank both Ident constraints. The tableau in (19) contains analyses for the inputs {um, bege} and {um, 0ali}. (Since no candidates conflict on Ident-Lab and Ident-Nas, it is not possible to rank them. Underlining in (19.1c,d) distinguishes homorganic clusters with shared and distinct place nodes, respectively.)

In (19.1) and (19.2), candidates in which/m/is faithfully parsed as a coda are elim- inated because they violate CodaCond, as expected. This result is the same regard- less of whether [m] and [b] share a place node, as in (19.1c), or not, as in (19.1d). The selection of prefixed candidates with geminates, ub.b~.ge and ug.g6.1i, as opti- mal shows that it is crucial that neither Ident constraint outranks Um--cr, as in either case we would expect an infixed output, even though infixation violates Affix-um. Under the usual OT assumptions, this would appear to motivate ranking Um=~ above both Ident-Lab and Ident-Nas, since subordinating Um=t~ to either would incorrectly predict (19.1b) and (19.2b) to be optimal. The final set of forms to consider are those in which um is concatenated with a C- initial stem which is neither labial nor nasal, for example gokan. In these cases, um is infixed before the first V in the optimal candidates, gu.mo.k6n. Coming after the analysis presented in (19), the infixed outcome is puzzling: the tableau in (20) shows that the ranking Um~t~ >> Ident-Lab : Ident-Nas apparently required to select the pre- fixed candidates in (19) incorrectly predicts a prefixed and assimilated output *ug.go.k6n for {um, gokan}.

The inputs {um, ta0is} and {um, tubuh~n} offer a different and intriguing possi- bility, because the roots taqis and tubuhan contain an intervocalic [+nasal] and labial C, respectively, to which/m/in um could assimilate. Tableau (21) shows that if the hierarchy posited for (19) is correct, Affix-um's low ranking predicts that um should infix after the first syllable ta, with/m/assimilating to ]~/to satisfy Ident-Nas. In this case, the prefixed candidate with a geminate should be less optimal because both Ident-Lab and Ident-Nas are violated. (21) CodaCond ."

Therefore, Um=g must not be ranked above Ident-Lab. A similar argument can be made for Ident-Nas, based on the input {um, tubuhan}: ranking Urn=or above Ident-Nas predicts a hyper-infixed candidate with an assimilated/m/, *tu.ub.bu.han, instead of the attested tu.mu.bu.han. Therefore, Urn=or must not be ranked above Ident-Nas. Thus, the ranking posited for (19) fails to select the attested outputs gu.mo.k6n and tu.ma.~is in (20) and (21). On the other hand, tableau (22) shows that attested outputs are exactly what we expect if Um=cr is ranked below the Ident constraints. 576 M.

A ranking paradox The problem with our analysis is that we've arrived at a ranking paradox: How is it possible to have one ranking of the Ident constraints and Um=a for some forms, and a different ranking for others? The answer, of course, is that we can't. Note that if it were possible to count a violation of any of the three constraints Ident-Lab, Ident-Nas, and Um=a equally in determining outcomes, the attested outcomes would be correctly selected as optimal in every case. The solution is to treat the Ident con- straints and Um=o as crucially unranked, as though they share a single column in the OT tableau. I refer to this relation as co-ranking. The constraint sub-hierarchy we require under the co-ranking approach, then, is CodaCond ~ Ident-Lab = ldent-Nas M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 577 = Um~tr ~ Affix-um (where co-ranking is indicated with the symbol '=' to distin- guish it from trivial non-ranking, ': '.) Cases in which um prefixes to V-initial stems are uncomplicated, as nothing forces violations of the co-ranked constraints. Analyses for the inputs {um, rjali}, {um, bege}, and {um, gokan} under the co-ranking approach are shown in (23).

Ident-Nas Once the CodaCond violators have been excluded in (23.1) and (23.2), the remain- ing candidates are tied with a single violation in the co-ranked block. In each case, the tie is broken by Affix-um, bumping ug.~6.li and ub.b~.ge to optimal status. Mov- ing on, candidates (23.3d,e,f) are excluded because each incurs a second fatal viola- tion of CodaCond. Candidate (23.3c) expires early because it has two co-ranked vio- lations. The remaining candidates tie with one violation each of Ident-Lab or Um--cy. As discussed above, the decision falls to Affix-um It was noted above that cases in which um affixes to a base like gokan or tatlis which begin with a non-labial oral C provide the one context in which Affix-urn acts on candidate sets. In fact, Affix-um is not quite sufficient to select optimal candi- dates in this context. Recall that when um affixes to V-initial bases,/m/is geminated (cf. um.mu.li). But, if/m/is geminated pre-vocalically with bases like uli, why not also with bases like gokan and taxis? In other words, it still remains to rule out potential candidates like *gum.mo.k6n and *tum.m6.~is. These candidates are 578 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 equivalent to the optimal candidates in (22) and (23) with respect to the constraints introduced so far; therefore, one final constraint is necessary to complete the analy- sis. Consonant gemination is arguably a marked option crosslinguistically, due, I assume, to the presence of the constraint *GEMINATE in (24). *Geminate prohibits the multiple association of Cs by requiting their root nodes to be unambiguously affiliated with organizing structureJ 8 (24) *GEMINATE: Consonantal root nodes are uniquely dominated. *Geminate is violated once by every multiply associated root node. Clearly, *Gemi- nate must be ranked low in Toba Batak, as many optimal forms with um violate it, and as geminates are freely tolerated in the language more generally. The tableau in (25) shows that ranking *Geminate with Affix-um below the co-ranked constraints correctly results in the selection of the ungeminated candidate as optimal. (It is not possible to determine a ranking for Affix-urn and *Geminate.) (25) Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas = Um~.a ~ Affix-um Ł *Geminate Candidates a.~ b. C. Ident-Lab Ident-Nas Um~ *Gem ! Affix-um gu.mo.k~n * Um=o :; g Ł gum.mo.k~in * Um~o * ! *ug.go.kfm * Ident-Lab * ! Ident-Nas g Before V-initial stems, then,/rn/is geminated to satisfy Um=o. But when um is infixed and becomes part of a syllable with an onset, gemination does not improve urn-syllable alignment, and so is avoided. The relation of crucial non-ranking motivated in Section 3 is referred to as co- ranking to distinguish it from the different type of non-ranking in which two con- straints cannot be prioritized because they do not come into conflict. An example is provided by the Ident constraints discussed herein. No dominance relation can be imposed on Ident-Lab and Ident-Nas because there is no input for which either of these constraints determines the outcome at the expense of the other. But, just as we can determine dominance by transitivity, so it is possible to determine that two con- straints are co-ranked by examining the interaction of each with a third. I argued above that Um=o must be co-ranked with each of the Ident constraints. Um=o must not be ranked below either Ident-Lab or Ident-Nas, as this predicts the unattested out- puts *~u.raa.li and *bu.me.ge for the inputs {um, rjali} and {um, bege}. Neither can Um=o be ranked above either Ident-Lab or Ident-Nas, as this predicts the unattested ~8 *Geminate's counterpart for Vs is NoLongVowels, proposed by Rosenthall (1994). M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 579 outputs *ta.u~,~is and *tu.ub.bu.h~n for the inputs {um,tarjis} and {urn, tubuhan}. If Um~¢r neither dominates nor is dominated by either of the Ident constraints, then the Ident constraints must also be co-ranked, for if one of the Ident constraints domi- nated the other, then it would also dominate Um=t~, the very situation shown not to exist. To summarize, the constraint sub-hierarchy proposed to account for the Toba Batak facts presented so far is that in (26). (26) CodaCond >~ Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas = Um=t~ ~ *Geminate : Affix-um The highest ranking constraint in the sub-hierarchy is CodaCond, which penalizes consonant root nodes singly linked in syllable-final position. CodaCond is never vio- lated by the prefix um, though higher-ranked correspondence constraints not dis- cussed in detail here are presumably responsible for CodaCond violations within root morphemes. It was noted earlier that CodaCond could be replaced by Onset in accounting for um-affixation with V-initial stems (e.g. um.mar.ga). However, Onset cannot do the work of CodaCond in cases with C-initial stems. In these cases, replac- ing CodaCond with Onset would incorrectly predict infixed outputs (e.g. *qu.md.li, *bu.mLge) when in fact prefixed ones are attested. The three co-ranked constraints Ident-Lab, Ident-Nas, and Um=t~ are subordinated to CodaCond. It is interesting to note that one of these constraints is always violated when um affixes to a C-initial base. When competing candidates tie on the co-ranked constraints, their status is set- tled by the next constraints in line, Affix-urn and *Geminate. The anti-gemination constraint, *Geminate, is low in the hierarchy; violated in many optimal forms it nonetheless is the reason why/m/is not geminated in infixed candidates. 4. A new look at Tagalog In this section I bring the discussion full circle to the comparison case of um infix- ation in Tagalog. If CodaCond and not NoCoda is highly ranked in Toba Batak, then how can the relationship between these cognate systems be captured? Consider the similarity between CodaCond constraints, which result in the neutralization of seg- mental contrasts in codas, and NoCoda, which results in the non-occurrence of seg- ments in the same position. The ultimate suppression effectively dealt by NoCoda is duplicated by CodaCond(Root) if the association of a single root node to coda and onset positions is prevented by another constraint. The constraint which performs this role is *Geminate. In fact, the tableau in (27) shows that simply moving *Gem- inate to a position above the co-ranked constraint trio motivated earlier derives the infixing pattern of Tagalog. Tableau (27) re-analyses the Tagalog inputs {urn, ibig} 'wish', {um, bili} 'buy' (Blake, 1925: 55), and {um, gradwet}. 580 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 (27) Tagalog: CodaCond : *Geminate ~ Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas = Urtr-.a ~ Affix-urn ttes CodaCond *Gem Ident-Lab Affix-urn Ident-Nas Um~.c u.mLbig * * Um=o Ł i.bu.mig * * Um=o Ł v Ł *um.mf.big *um.f.big ** ! bu.mi.lf *ub.bi.lf *um.bi.li * ! *um.bi.li * ! gru.mad.wet ** *ug.grad.wet ** *Ulj.grad.wet *** ! *gum.rad.wet *** [ *urn.grad.wet *** [ An implication of this analysis is that it may be possible to reduce the universal inventory of constraints by removing NoCoda and attributing its effects to the com- bined activity of the independently motivated constraints CodaCond(Root) and *Geminate. I return to this point in the conclusion. Simply moving *Geminate above the co-ranked trio of constraints results in an unnecessarily complicated ranking pattern for Tagalog. With CodaCond and *Gem- inate outranking Affix-urn, the effects of the constraints Um=~, Ident-Lab, and Ident-Nas are not visible in Tagalog, and the exact ranking relationships between the latter three constraints (i.e. crucial ranking vs. nonranking) cannot be determined. For Tagalog, then, the sub-hierarchy in (28) is sufficient, with the assumption that Um-~o, Ident-Lab, and Ident-Nas are ranked too low to act on the candidate set. (28) CodaCond >> *Geminate >> Affix-um The Tagalog pattern of um-infixation, whether productive or not, is widespread among Malayo-Polynesian languages. Other languages with this pattern include Chamorro (Topping, 1973), Yogad (Davis et al., 1996), and Ilokano (Davis, 1995). Toba Batak differs from Tagalog in having bumped Urn=o, Ident-Lab, and Ident- Nas into positions of prominence above *Geminate and Affix-urn. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 581 5. Toba Batak: Percival's prefixes At this point, I introduce and analyze a subset of data described by Percival (1981) which illustrates an alternative, apparently innovative pattern of affixation with urn in Toba Batak. This alternative applies only to those cases in which urn con- catenates with a base beginning in a non-labial, oral C. In these cases, exemplified in (29), a prefixed alternative is available to the infixed forms in (8).

However, Cartalyna Napitupulu, a native speaker born in the mid-1950s reports that the prefixed forms have become the norm both for herself and for others she has consulted. 19 The important phonological point is that when um is prefixed,/m/is fully assim- ilated to the following stem-initial C, exactly as for the labial and nasal-initial stems discussed in Section 3. In fact, the prefixing pattern in (29) was an outcome pre- dicted under the analysis rejected in Section 3, in which Um~g occupied a dominant position over Ident-Lab and Ident-Nas. However, the ranking Um~.o >> Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas considered earlier does not predict the attested prefixed outcomes in all cases. Recall from Tableau (21) that when a medial C is a singleton nasal (or equiv- alently, labial), the ranking Um=o , Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas predicts an infixed can- didate with /m/ assimilated to the medial C (e.g. *sa.um.mal as opposed to us.sS.mal). The correct forms are selected in all cases if we modify the hierarchy motivated in Section 3.2 (see (26)) by raising Affix-urn to undominated position above the co-ranked constraints, leading to the sub-hierarchy in (30). 20 19 Cartalyna Napitupulu, personal emall communication, February 7, 1997. 2o It is important to note that the analysis developed here for urn does not generalize to the other mor- phemes in Toba Batak which alternate between prefixing and infixing behaviour. Interestingly, both of these morphemes contain a coronal as opposed to a labial C, and they behave differently not only from 582 M.

As um is always prefixed in these cases and satisfies Affix-urn, the outcome is predicted to be the same regard- less of whether Affix-um is ranked above or below the co-ranked constraints.) Certain considerations suggest that the prefixing forms in (29) are innovative, the effects of a synchronic change in progress. First, the prefixing pattern illustrated in (29) is not mentioned in Van der Tuuk (1971), the most comprehensive survey of Toba Batak at the end of the last century. 21 Tuuk does cite prefixed forms with labial assimilation. The labially assimilating pattern is well established, and must be quite old. I base this assumption not only mentions of such forms by V an der Tuuk, but um, but also from one another. In brief, the passive completive participial morpheme has two allo- morphs, a prefix ni and an infix in which is described as occurring after the In'st C in morphemes begin- ning with/p t k c b d 5 g s h/- that is, all but the voiced alveolars (Nababan, 1981: 61, 74). A second morpheme al, whose semantics are unclear, is described as forming 'primary derived noun stems' (Nababan, 1981: 93-94). Al appears to prefix to V-initial bases (e.g. al-6go 'wind'), and to infix after any stem-initial C. An assimilated variant ar combines with bases containing [r] (e.g. b-al-Cttuk 'ladder', b-ar-~raq 'sulphur', h-ar-fhir 'nose ring (of animals)' N94). Further work is needed to relate the behav- iour of these affixes to that of urn. 21 Van der Tuuk (1971) includes a brief but helpful discussion of um. Van der Tuuk was not used as a primary reference for this paper because his methodology leaves some doubt as to the phonetic facts. Apparently, Van der Tuuk induced Toba Batak speakers to write down sentences and words, which he then analysed. However, it is reasonable to assume that since he commented on the alternation of urn with ub and up before labial stops, he would have commented on any forms resembling those in (29). Van der Tuuk mentions only the infixing pattern for stems beginning in nonlabial oral Cs. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 583 also based on evidence that at least one such form, ub.b6en, based on the root baen 'to make, do', has undergone a functional shift and may be used to introduce clauses of result (Nababan, 1981 : 129). An example appears in (32). (32) di-bbta h6 da ahi-na, ubb/ken margbar known thou aff'mnative partic, cause-its um-do have name amaddbrap ~iu Father of Punching I 'The reason is known by thee, why I am called Father of Punching' N129 A second reason for believing the exclusively prefixing pattern to be innovative is based on native speaker intuitions. Percival (1981: 39) comments that "[i]n general, [his] informants regard the forms with the infix as 'more correct', and in some cases label the forms with the prefix as 'childish' or 'unacceptable'", indicating that pre- fixing before non-labial oral Cs was not standard in the 1950s. However, Napitupulu indicates that many speakers now generally prefer prefixed forms to infixed um forms, which they consider to be more formal and poetic. 22 Percival reports that even for his informants, some prefixed forms were preferred over the infixed alter- natives. These observations suggest a growing trend in the direction of prefixation. Such a trend might be explained as an analogical shift, with infixing cases being brought into line with already existing prefixing ones (such as ub.b~.ge). It appears, then, that Toba Batak has been undergoing a shift from the hierarchy proposed in (26) for Nababan's data to the hierarchy in (30). It also seems possible that some speakers may control both hierarchies, each associated with a different linguistic register. It does not seem sensible, in light of variable data, to cling to the strong assump- tion that speakers control only a single constraint hierarchy. If this were the case, then variable data would present a problem, but not necessarily an insurmountable one. To account for Japanese data in which voiced velars/g/and/rj/altemate freely under certain circumstances (the so-called ga-gy6 variation) It6 and Mester (to appear) propose an account in which two principle constraints are freely ranked. Under free ranking, according to these authors, speakers may freely choose which constraint is topmost, so that one alternant is selected in some instances, the other altemant in others. The possibility of free ranking might be entertained for Toba Batak as well. In that case, the variation between Nababan's pattern and the exclu- sively prefixing pattern observed with Toba Batak um could be accounted for by ranking Affix-um freely with the co-ranked trio Ident-Lab, Ident-Nas, and Um--cr. 22 Cartalyna Napitupulu, personal e-mail communication, February 7, 1997. Another way in which Ms. Napitupulu's speech differs from Nababan's is that for Ms. Napitupulu, the geminate [bb] alternates in some cases with a homorganic [mb] cluster in forms with urn prefixed to b-initial stems. Ms Napitupulu notes that she both uses and hears more forms with [bb] than with [mb]. She also notes that *[rap] instead of [pp] with p-initial bases is not possible. As noted earlier, Percival (1981) is not clear about these cases. [mb], but not [nap] clusters in um forms are cited in Van tier Tuuk (1971). Since the details of a possible bb/mb alternations are not especially clear, I have not proposed an analysis. 584 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 This possibility is represented in (33), with the freely ranked components of the hier- archy enclosed in braces. (33) f Affix-um t CodaCond >> Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas = Um=6 >> *Geminate However, a free ranking approach predicts free variation, not the situation encoun- tered in Toba Batak, where some prefixed forms (those in (29a)) are preferred while others (the ones in (29b)) are not. In addition, the free ranking solution proposed to generate the observed variation is only accidentally tied to the intuition that the rea- son for the variation is an analogical shift. 23 6. Some alternatives The analysis presented in this paper was proposed to account for two key obser- vations about the Toba Batak data cited, and ways in which these observations can be captured in an optimality theoretic account. The first is that when um is prefixed in Toba Batak, /m/ never surfaces as a singleton consonant either in coda or onset position. When prefixed to C-initial roots, in particular,/m/assimilates fully to a fol- lowing C. The approach taken in this paper has been to model the forced assimila- tion of/m/as an effect of a coda condition, (12), that bars root nodes from syllable codas. It would also be possible to treat the assimilating behaviour of/m/as an effect of onset licensing constraints (see for example Lombardi, 1999; Borowsky, 2000). Under this alternative, we would replace CodaCond in (12) with a constraint stipu- lating that root nodes are licensed in onset position. This substitution does not sub- stantially change any of the points in this paper; all would be equally congruent with an onset licensing approach. As long as geminates are excluded in Tagalog, it is still possible to connect the Tagalog and Toba Batak patterns if the onset licensing alter- native is adopted. The second observation which the analysis proposed above is designed to handle concerns the conditions under which um can be a prefix in Nababan's Toba Batak. 23 Unless, of course, free ranking is always an intermediate stage between diachronically related gram- mars. This is not what It6 and Mester propose for the ga-gy6 variation in Japanese. A second limitation of OT accounts is that they do not predict the direction of diachronic change. The fact that um is infixed in C-initial stems in languages related to Toba Batak supports the assumption that the infix-yielding hierarchy for Toba Batak in (26) preceded the exclusively prefix-yielding hierarchy in (30) historically. Intuitively, this seems correct: infixes are quite marked crosslinguistically, and for that reason, we might on the face of it expect an infixing system to evolve into a prefixing system rather than the other way around. The markedness factor is not captured within OT, which places no higher value on one type of shift as opposed to the other, so that the shift from infixing to exclusively prefixing is treated as accidental. I would agree with Spike Gildea, who commented that to place upon any theory of phonology the burden of explaining why and how shifts occur may be unfair. The primary job of phono- logical theories is to capture generalizations about phonological behaviour both within and across lan- guages. What we require are independent theories of language evolution and phonology which can then inform one another. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 585 In that dialect, um is allowed to be a prefix when the first C of the root is a labial or a nasal; when the root-initial C is something else, um is infixed. The general expla- nation offered here is that a consonant, in this case/rn/, isn't allowed to assimilate fully to another consonant if this would result in the loss of/m/'s specifications for both of the features [nasal] and [labial]. The loss of the specification for either of these features, however, is tolerated: when /rn/assimilates to /p/ or/b/, it loses [+nasal]. When/m/assimilates to another nasal, it loses [LABIAL]. An analysis in which the relevant Ident constraints (Ident-Nas and Ident-Lab) are conventionally ranked fails to capture this threshold effect (one violation, but not two), leading instead to a ranking paradox. In the analysis proposed here, the threshold problem is resolved by co-ranking Ident-Nas and Ident-Lab, and also Um=t~ (for reasons moti- vated earlier). Recall that co-ranked constraints behave as though they inhabit the same cell of an OT tableau in that a violation of either constraint counts equally in evaluating candidates. Another way of handling the threshold effect might be to locally conjoin the relevant constraints. Local conjunction (Smolensky, 1993, 1995, 1997) conjoins violations of constraints: when two constraints are locally conjoined, A&B, the conjunction is violated when a penalty is incurred for both conjuncts. 24 It is not violated when only one of the conjuncts (either A or B) is violated. Since vio- lations of the constraint Um=cr are treated uniformly with violations of Ident-Nas and Ident-Lab in this account, a local conjunction treatment of the Toba Batak facts would be obliged to make some non-standard assumptions. First, the local conjunc- tion of three constraints, as opposed to the usual two, would have to be allowed. This raises the question of, if we have a local conjunction A&B&C, must A, B, and C all be violated in order for a candidate to fail the conjunction. If so, then local conjunc- tion is not an appropriate device for Toba Batak, since candidates are rejected when only two of the conjoined constraints are violated. 7. Concluding remarks The preceding sections have made three main points. A theory-internal point was that a relation of co-ranking between constraints was required to avoid a ranking paradox in the analysis of Toba Batak (and that it is not clear that a local conjunc- tion account would be equally satisfactory). Co-ranking differs from conventional ranking in that when two constraints A and B are co-ranked, A=B, violations of A and B carry equal weight in the evaluation of candidates, so that neither constraint can be identified as more highly ranked than the other. Under conventional ranking, A>>B, one constraint is identified as ranking more highly than the other because a candidate violating the lower ranked constraint may be preferred to a candidate vio- lating the higher ranked constraint, but not vice versa. Second, both the Tagalog and Toba Batak facts are consistent with a CodaCond analysis, in line with Prince and Smolensky's (1993) and McCarthy and Prince's 24 The mode of constraint conjunction, proposed by Hewitt and Crowhurst (1996), Crowhurst and Hewitt are not successful in accounting for the Toba Batak facts. 586 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 (1993a,b) intuition that codas are an important factor leading to the infixation of um in Tagalog. 25 An Onset-driven analysis of infixation does not explain the infixing behaviour of urn in Toba Batak, in which geminate codas are frequently optimal. The third point was that a NoCoda-based analysis of infixation is no more successful in accounting for the Toba Batak facts than an Onset-based account if we accept the view of NoCoda that has emerged in optimality-theoretic work. (A strict NoCoda approach fails because infixing is not always used do avoid codas in Toba Batak. An Onset account fails because (i) infixing does not always apply when an onset is needed, and (ii) Onset has nothing to say about the enforced assimilation of/m/.) I argued that an adequate account of the Toba Batak facts should appeal to CodaCond constraints. However, if a CodaCond account of Toba Batak is adopted while a NoCoda account of the Tagalog facts is maintained, then the striking similarities between Tagalog and Toba Batak urn are dismissed as accidental. I argued in Section 4 that this is not necessary, and that a CodaCond account of Tagalog is possible. Specifically, I proposed that NoCoda effects in Tagalog are due to the combined effect of two constraints independently required for Toba Batak, a CodaCond con- straint restricting root nodes, CodaCond(Root), and the anti-gemination constraint, *Geminate. I showed how variation observed in the behaviour of the morpheme um in three related language varieties can be explained by appealing to an OT analysis which posits slightly different constraint sub-hierarchies. The sub-hierarchies required by the analyses developed in the previous sections are reviewed in (34). (34) a. b. c. Tagalog CodaCond : *Geminate , Affix-urn (... >> Ident-Lab, Ident-Nas, Um=t~) Toba Batak (mixed prefixation and infixation) CodaCond ~> Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas = Um~c >> *Geminate : Affix-urn Toba Batak (prefixation only) CodaCond : Affix-urn >> Ident-Lab = Ident-Nas = Um=~ >> *Geminate Toba Batak appears to be undergoing a shift from limited prefixation to exclusive prefixation, a change that could be accounted for by moving Affix-urn up in the hier- archy, as in (34c), a minimal difference from (34b) since only a single constraint has been re-ranked. 26 While we wouldn't always want to claim that reranking constraints causes language change, here the motivation can be seen as functional: if urn is grammatically a prefix, moving Affix-urn up in the hierarchy in fact directly reflects the strengthening of um's function by speakers. The proposal that coda-avoidance effects usually attributed to the constraint NoCoda in optimality-theoretic work can be duplicated by CodaCond(Root) and *Geminate should be discussed, as its implications extend beyond this analysis. First, it suggests that NoCoda should be removed from the universal inventory of con- straints altogether if its effects can be attributed to independently required constraints, 25 See the comments in the last section about a possible onset licensing account of Toba Batak. 26 Alternatively, it is possible that the two subhierarchies in (34b,c) represent separate dialects, though changes in the patterns of variation seem better explained under the shift hypothesis. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 587 though it would first necessary to establish that something like the analysis proposed here succeeds elsewhere. In proposing to expunge NoCoda from the general pool of constraints, it is also necessary to be clear about the difference between NoCoda and CodaCond(Root). The statement of NoCoda in (3), repeated in (35), states that only Vs should occur in syllable-final position. 27 (35) NOCODA: Align (~, Right, V, Right) Anything that is not a V; that is, all Cs; are completely excluded from syllable-final position by NoCoda, but only by specifying what is permitted. CodaCond(Root) in (12), repeated in (36), resembles anti-coda constraints that appeared in pre-OT work. (36) CODACOND(ROOT): * p ]o I °[+cons] (Root tier) CodaCond(Root) encodes a weaker restriction: uniquely dominated consonantal root nodes are excluded from syllable-final position, opening the door not only to Vs, but to Cs which are not single-linked (i.e. geminates). The two constraints are not the same. The generalization that specifically consonantal properties are prohibited in sylla- ble-final position has emerged from decades of research, from which emerges the notion of a continuum for coda-restricting behaviour, along which individual phono- logical systems can be arranged. Some languages apparently place no restrictions on syllable-final Cs (in the absence of a following C which triggers assimilation). Among the languages that constrain codas, two types of restrictions are observed. Some languages restrict coda Cs to members of a specific natural class (a positive constraint), or they may bar members of some natural class from occurring syllable- finally (a negative constraint). An example of the positive restriction is found in Japanese which, except for geminates, permits only nasal codas (Itr, 1986). Another example is presented by the Bolivian language Guarayu, which permits only coronal [r] to be a coda (Grinevald Craig, 1995; Crowhurst, 2000). An example of the neg- ative constraint is found in Toba Batak, in which voiced oral and nasal obstruents (unless geminated and except for [~]), are generally barred from codas, while other Cs may occur in this position (Nababan, 1981; Percival, 1981). To the extent that restrictions on codas target natural classes that must be defined by referring to phonological features (as opposed to a structural node such as CORONAL or LABIAL), we may wish to recognize within the CodaCond family a subset of constraints which we may schematize as CoDACOND(F), where F stands for a specified feature. If some subset of CodaCond(F) constraints which identify a natural class are ranked above some key constraint(s) (for example, constraints in the faithfulness family), the result 27 Other statements of NoCoda that have appeared in the OT literature, such as 'Syllables do not have codas', express the undesirability of syllable-f'mal Cs, but are too inexplicit to be of much use in a detailed examination. 588 M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 will be that members of the implicated natural class will not appear syllable-finally. Alternatively, when the same subset of constraints are ranked below the same faith- fulness constraints, members of the implicated natural class will be permitted to close syllables. The typological prediction noted here is represented schematically in (37). (37) a. CODACOND(Fx), CODACOND(Fy) ~ FAITHFULNESS ~ CODACOND(Fz) (Cs in the natural class defined by CodaCond(F x) and CodaCond(Fy) are not possible codas.) b. CoDACOND(Fz) ~ FAITHFULNESS r~ CODACOND(Fx) , CODACOND(Fy) (Cs in the natural class defined by CodaCond(Fx) and CodaCond(Fy) are possible codas.) Naturally, the more inclusive the natural class, the greater the number of Coda- Cond(F) constraints clustering together above or below relevant Faithfulness con- straints. The second type of restriction in terms of codas is best understood as structural. In such cases, a restricted class may be defined solely in terms of a sub-segmental constituent, as defined in terms of standard feature-geometric representations (e.g. McCarthy, 1988). Examples of negative restrictions abound: Japanese forbids singly linked place nodes in syllable-final position (It6, 1986, 1989). In Toba Batak, as we have seen, consonant root nodes are restricted, and it is well-known that in Korean (Iverson, 1989), marked laryngeal features may not be associated with coda Cs. In addition to CodaCond(F) constraints, we recognize within the CodaCond family a subgroup of CODACOND(STRUC), where 'Struc' refers to a specified structural ele- ment, such as a root, labial, laryngeal, or articulator node. Typological predictions similar to those represented in (37) can be made for structurally defined natural classes by replacing CodaCond(Fx,y,z) in (37) with CodaCond(Struc) constraints. In general, we expect restrictions on codas to be mediated by both CodaCond(F) and CodaCond(Struc) constraints. Again, Toba Batak provides an example. I argued above that in this language, CodaCond(Root) is highly ranked, with the effect that geminates are permitted, but not independent consonantal root nodes in coda posi- tion. However, the sonorants [r 1 r]] are permitted as codas, suggesting that while many segmental Faithfulness constraints are ranked below CodaCond(Root), at least one such constraint, IDENT-IO(SONORANT), is more highly ranked. Claimed effects of CodaCond(Root) are still evident, even with sonorants: Toba Batak does not permit *rl or *Ir clusters, though geminates rr and II (mainly the latter) are attested. Notice that this what we would expect given a ranking Ident-IO(Sonorant) ~ CodaCond(Root): *rl, *lr, rr, II all pass Ident-IO(Sonorant), but the non-geminates fail CodaCond(Root). As for velars, that [O] but not [m n] is a possible coda is expected if two constraints, CodaCond(Labial) and CodaCond(Coronal) are highly ranked, but CodaCond(Dorsal) is too low in the hierarchy to have an impact. 28 28 CodaCond(Coronal) must rank below Ident-IO(Sonorant) to account for the preservation of sonorant coronals. M. Crowhurst / Lingua 111 (2001) 561-590 589 The intention here is more to suggest directions for future research on coda con- ditions than to provide a comprehensive account. Therefore, I conclude with a re- statement of the primary point of this work: A finding that NoCoda effects can be subsumed by CodaCond would be gratifying, because a CodaCond approach unites strong and weak anti-coda effects under the well-supported generalization that some- thing specifically about consonants is undesirable in syllable-final position. This generalization is not captured by the NoCoda in (35), which expresses the desirabil- ity of syllable-f'mal Vs, but is silent about consonants. References Blake, F., 1925.
