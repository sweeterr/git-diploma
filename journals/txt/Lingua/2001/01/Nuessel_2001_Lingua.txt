E-mail: fhnuesOl@athena.louisville.edu Co-authors Ntiiiez-Cedeiio (1980, 1985, 1986, 1988a,b, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1997) and Morales-Front (1994, 1999; Martinez-Gil and Morales Front, 1997) of Fonologia generativa contemporhea de la lengua espaiiola (‚Contemporary Gener- ative phonology of the Spanish language™) have established a solid reputation in the theoretical analysis of Spanish phonology. Researchers in this area, and phonologists in general, have expressed an interest in an up-to-date volume on the theoretical phonology of Spanish for some time. Now, these two highly regarded phonologists, Nliiez-Cedefio and Morales-Front (henceforth N.-C. and M.-F.), have provided just such a book. In their prologue (p. xiv), N.-C. and M.-F. provide an attribution of authorship of specific chapters in this volume not only to themselves (Nuiiez-Cedefio, chapters 2-4; Morales-Front, chapters 1, 7-9) but also to two other well-known phonologists, namely, Pilar Prieto i Vives (Introduction, chapter 6) and Jose Ignacio Hualde (chap- ter 5). The latter has published a number of important works in Spanish phonology (Hualde, 1989a,b,c, 1991, 1994, 1999) as has the former (Prieto, 1992a,b, 1993, 1994; Prieto et al., 1996). In their prologue (p. xiv), N.-C. and M.-F. point out that they assume that the reader of this book is familiar with the standard theory of generative phonology (Chomsky and Halle, 1968). They also advise the reader to be familiar with the fol- lowing books, namely, Contreras and Lleo (1982), D™Introno et al. (1995), Ken- stowicz and Kisseberth (1979), Kenstowicz (1994), and Sommerstein (1995). N.-C. and M.-F. further note (p. xiv) that Kenstowicz (1994) served as the inspiration for the format of the present volume. Books on generative grammatical approaches to Spanish phonology include sev- eral noteworthy individual volumes such as those by Saporta and Contreras (1962) 037%2166/01/$ - see front matter 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

(1995), Sosa (1999). In addition, there are anthologies by Nuessel(1985), Bjarkman and Hammond (1989), the phonology and morphology section of the Campos and Martinez-Gil anthology (1991: 405-635), and the Span- ish section of the Martinez-Gil and Morales-Front anthology (1997: 469-694). Moreover, the annual proceedings volumes of the Linguistic Symposia on Romance Languages frequently feature studies on various aspects of Spanish phonology. Finally, several doctoral dissertations have pointed the way to important new research trends in Spanish phonology (Morgan, 1984; Wong-Opasi, 1986; McDon- ald, 1988; Ortiz, 1988; Carreira, 1990; Martinez-Gil, 1990; Dunlap, 1991; Prieto, 1993; Morales-Front, 1994; Colina, 1995; Galindo, 1997; Piiieros, 1998). Doctoral research often represents cutting edge inquiry, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and the Ohio State University are well represented. The history of generative phonological analyses of Spanish can be traced back to Saporta and Contreras™s (1962) slim monograph on this topic. Two decades after its publication, Harris (1983: 3) would cite it and Hooper (1976) as important antecedents in the study of Spanish syllable structure. Harris™s (1969) first foray into generative phonology was, of course, strictly linear in accordance with the standard model (Chomsky and Halle, 1968). Following subsequent models (Goldsmith, 1976; Halle and Vergnaud, 1980; Liberman and Prince, 1977; McCarthy, 1979a), Harris (1983) provided a non-linear analysis of Spanish phonology. More recently, D™Introno et al. (1995) published a theoretical overview of Spanish phonology and morphology. N.-C. and M.-F.‚s book constitutes an important new and up-to-date volume about linguistic theories applied to Spanish phonology. The introductory chapter (‚Zntroduccidn: La fonologiu™ [Introduction: Phonol- ogy], pp. l-22; see Kenstowicz, 1994: l-l 1) is a historical account of phonetics and phonology since the time of Saussure (1916), and one continued by members of the Prague School including Roman Jakobson (Jakobson et al., 1952) and Nikolai Tru- betzkoy (1958 [1939]). Subsequently, Chomsky and Halle (1968) would publish their definitive statement on generative phonology, a document that had been circu- lating in pre-publication form for four years. This model allowed others to apply that model to other languages including Spanish (Harris, 1969) and French (Schane, 1968). Goldsmith™s (1976, 1979, 1981) tiered, or layered model subsequently allowed reference to partial segments of a sound. Moreover, it facilitated the theo- retical description of suprasegmental elements such as stress, pitch and tone. Metri- cal and prosodic phonology developed through the groundbreaking work of Liber- man (1975) and Liberman and Prince (1977) who recognized the significance of the syllable and the foot in phonological theory. Archangeli (1984, 1988; see also Pul- leyblank, 1988; Archangeli and Pulleyblank, 1994; It6 and Mester, 1989) addressed the theoretical question of feature underspecification whose ultimate effect is the simplification of phonological rules. In recent years, Optimality Theory has gained much attention among phonologists (Prince and Smolensky, 1993; McCarthy and Prince, 1993a,b), and it has been used by Morales-Front (1994, 1999), Colina (1995, 1999) and others. Book review I Lingua 111 (2001) 5342 55 Chapter 1 (‚De la fone™tica descriptiva a 10s rasgos distintivos™ [From phonetics to distinctive features] pp. 2342; see Kenstowicz, 1994: 12-194) is a traditional, albeit thorough, review of phonetics and distinctive features which is best read in conjunction with the first two chapters of D™Introno et al. (1995: 1 l-3 13). In the next chapter (‚Fonofogia autosegmental™ [Autosegmental phonology], pp. 43-71; see Kenstowicz, 1994: 310-394) reviews the research on phonology within the autosegmental model (Goldsmith, 1981; McCarthy, 1979a,b; Clements and Keyser, 1983). The fundamental contribution of Goldsmith™s work was to introduce an inherently non-linear dimension to phonology. N.-C. and M.-F. present autoseg- mental analyses of several common phonological processes in Spanish, namely, vowel harmony described by Zamora Vicente (1974; see also McCarthy, 1984), aspiration of /s/, aspiration of /f/ and /r/, and nasal assimilation. McCarthy (1979a) and others began to apply Goldsmith™s (1976) model which resulted in a non-linear conceptualization of phonology. Three-dimensional phonology (Halle and Vergnaud, 1980; Clements and Keyser, 1983) ultimately emerged. The resulting phonological skeleton with its tripartite layer of syllable-C[onsonant]/V[owel]-seg- mental tier came into being. Several studies in Spanish phonology employed this new apparatus to address problems such as plural formation (Harris, 1980), gender markers (Harris, 1985b, 1991a), and hypochoristics (Lipski, 1995). Yet another off- shoot of the phonological skeleton is the X-slot model of the skeleton (Kaye and Lowenstamm, 1984; Levin, 1985). This innovation led to an alternative treatment for the phenomenon of compensatory vowel lengthening in Spanish (formerly addressed by recourse to the excessively powerful notion of a global rule; see Ham- mond, 1986; Nlfiez-Cedeilo, 1989). The third chapter (‚Modelo autosegmental jercirquico™ [Hierarchical autosegmen- tal phonology], pp. 72-133; see Kenstowicz, 1994: 451-506) contains a discussion of hierarchical autosegmental phonology which is a refinement of Goldsmith™s (1976) original autosegmental model. In particular, later generative phonologists (Clements, 1985; Halle, 1992; Sagey, 1986; McCarthy, 1988) argued that feature specification had an inherent hierarchy which allowed phonologically-related fea- tures to operate as a group and to control tone and point of articulation. The signifi- cance of feature trees is that ﬁ. . . some features are best thought of as introducing a subdistinction within the category defined by another feature . . . ﬂ and that ﬁ. . . cer- tain features form recurrent groupings in phonological rules and constraintsﬂ (Ken- stowicz, 1994: 146). Kenstowicz (1994: 452) points out that the Halle [ 1992]-Sagey [ 19861 Articulator Model of feature geometry and its predecessors have undergone substantial change since its original introduction. The authors then discuss certain principles of this model, namely, The Obligatory Contour Principle (pp. 93-106; see also Leben, 1973, 1980; McCarthy, 1979a), and the Condition of Inalterability (pp. 107-l 13) and their application to Spanish data. Finally, N.-C. and M.-F. review Adjacency Theory (pp. 127-133; Odden, 1994) with its Locality Principle. Chapter 4 (‚Teoria de la subespecificacidn™ [Underspecification theory], pp. 134- 169; see Kenstowicz, 1994: 506-516 and passim) is a discussion of the theory set forth by Archangeli (1984) in her MIT doctoral dissertation based, in part, on work by Kiparsky (1982). In this chapter, N.-C. and M.-F. use a definition of underspeci- 56 Book review I Lingua 11 I (2001) 53-62 fication taken from Sagey (1986: 20) which states that ﬁno feature exists such that it has to specify a value for said feature in every phonemeﬂ (p. 140, translation my own, FN). The authors then discuss how to address certain classical problems of Spanish phonology within this framework (see Rota, 1994), e.g., e-epenthesis (Nbiiez-Cedefio, 1980; Harris, 1980; Jaeggli, 1980), vowel harmony in Spanish (Penny, 1969; McCarthy 1984). and nasal assimilation (Harris, 1983, 1984a,b; Ntiiiez-Cedefio, 1980). A final section addresses restricted underspecification with examples from Latin and Basque. The authors conclude this chapter by noting the following points about this approach to phonology: ﬁ. . . (1) the predictable informa- tion is deduced from rules; (2) it is more coherent from a conceptual and theoretical point of view; (3) it takes into account vocalic asymmetries; and (4) it explains the unusual vowel inventories in various languagesﬂ (p. 169, translation my own, IN). The following chapter (‚La silabifcacibn en espafiof™ [Syllabification in Spanish], pp. 170-188; see Kenstowicz, 1994: 250-309) sets forth the role of the syllable in the phonological analysis of Spanish. Saporta and Contreras (1962), Hooper (1976), Harris (1983, see references cited on p. 137, note l), Ntiiiez-Cedeiio (1986), Hualde (1991) have all addressed various aspects of the syllable in Spanish phonology. Included in this chapter are discussions of moraic structure (Hayes, 1995), and spe- cific Spanish issues such as compensatory lengthening (Hammond, 1986; Hayes, 1989), and hiatus and diphthongs, resyllabification of vocalic groups (Hualde, 1994; Galindo, 1997). Chapter 6 (‚La fonofogia lhica ™ [Lexical phonology], pp. 189-202; see Ken- stowicz, 1994: 195-249) deals with the fact that the Chomsky and Halle (1968) model of generative phonology could not access lexical and morphological informa- tion (p. 190). As a result, in the 1970s Siegel (1974) and Aronoff (1976) began to examine the interaction of phonological rules with other components of the gram- mar. Mascara™s (1976) Principle of Strict Cyclicity (see Halle, 1978) addressed addi- tional problems related to Chomsky and Halle™s (1968: 60) notion of cyclic and post-cyclic rules through its theoretical economy and its reference to a general prin- ciple known as the Strict Cycle Condition (Kenstowicz, 1994: 208-209). By the 1980s Kiparsky (1982, 1985) and Mohanan (1982) had developed a sophisticated theoretical model now known as Lexical Phonology. This theoretical model included additional principles such as the Elsewhere Condition, Structure Preservation (Har- ris, 1983; Wong-Opasi, 1986). Nevertheless, this model, as Kenstowicz (1994: 227-243) points has several outstanding problems, e.g., the need for two sets of postcyclic lexical rules (Kaisse, 1985), bracketing paradoxes (Halle and Vergnaud, 1987a), and so forth. In the next chapter (‚El ucento™ [Stress], pp. 203-230; see Kenstowicz, 1994: 548-621), N.-C. and M.-F. examine theoretical models that focus on stress assign- ment. According to Kenstowicz (1994: 553), Liberman™s (1975) metrical grid ﬁ. . . permits the special aspects of stress to be represented in a particularly perspicuous mannerﬂ. After Liberman™s (1975) initial foray into the theoretical representation of stress, others addressed related issues such as the metrical tree (Libennan and Prince, 1977; Hayes, 1980; Hammond, 1984). The rest of this chapter deals with the formalization of a metrical theory of stress (Hayes, 1995) and its application to Book review I Lingua 111 (2001) 5342 57 Spanish, e.g., stress assignment questions (ultimate, penultimate, antepenultimate placement) in the verbal and nominal systems (Rota, 1991, 1997; Harris, 1991b, 1992, 1995). As the authors point out, the question of the role of stress in Spanish phonology leaves many unresolved issues (p. 230; Kenstowicz, 1994: 593-605). The following two chapters address stress assignment within the emergent Optimal- ity Theory. The penultimate chapter (‚Teoriu de la optimidud™ [Optimality theory], pp. 231- 250) deals with the latest theoretical model in phonology known as Optimality The- ory (McCarthy and Prince, 1993a; Prince and Smolensky, 1993). In essence, this new theory consists of five basic components (pp. 238-239): (1) universality, i.e., a set of universal grammatical restrictions; (2) violatability, i.e., the rules may be vio- lated but such violations are minimal; (3) hierarchization, i.e., each language has its own hierarchical constraints; (4) inclusivity, i.e., the well-formedness conditions are based on general considerations; and (5) parallelism, i.e., the constraints operate simultaneously. The final chapter (‚El acento y la optimidad™ [Stress and optimality], pp. 251- 276) addresses the issue of stress within the context of Optimality Theory. The imprint of Morales-Front (1994, 1999) is apparent in this chapter and the previous two. Both he and Colina (1995, 1999) are among those phonologists who are utiliz- ing Optimality in the analysis of Spanish. A ‚Bibliografia™ (pp. 277-288), ‚Apuntes de transcripcidn fone™tica™ (p. 289), and an ‚Zndice de temas y fenguas™ (pp. 291-294) complement this volume. In a second edition of this important text, N.-C. and M.-F. will need to review and revise the bib- liography for several reasons. First, on p. 278, citations for James W. Harris (1984b through 1995) appear immediately after the Bowen and Stockwell (1956) citation and before the Canfield (198 1) citation. The latter (Canfield, 198 1) has no date of publication listed (as do two other citations: Halle and Vergnaud, 1987b, p. 280; Kaisse, 1992, p. 282). The James W. Harris citations (1984b to 1995) also appear in their proper place (pp. 280-281). Second, there are textual references to works that do not appear in the bibliography, e.g., Halle (1992, p. 74) Hayes (1989, p. 180) McCarthy (1979, p. 94 = McCarthy, 1979a), Nufiez-Cedefio (1993, p. 122). Third, there are textual references that have one date of publication in the main text, and a different one in the bibliography, e.g., Kenstowicz (1993, p. 80 = Kenstowicz, 1994, p. 283); Clements and Hume (1993, p. 119 = Clements and Hume, 1995, p. 279), Sagey (1976, p. 140 = Sagey, 1986, p. 286). Next, there is one incorrect reference (Harris, 1985b, p. 110 should be Harris, 1985a in the bibliography at the end of this review [in the N.-C. and M.-F. text, it refers to Harris, 1985b listed in the bibliogra- phy in this review]). In fact, the real Harris (1985a) listed at the end of this review does not appear in the Harris citations in the bibliography (pp. 280-281). Finally, there are two textual references (Harris, 1984, p. 154; Kiparsky, 1982, p. 190) which have two citations for the same year in the bibliography (Harris 1984a,b, p. 280; Kiparksy, 1982a,b, p. 283). The multiple authorship of the various chapters alluded to above (p. xiv), no doubt, contributed to this situation. These bibliographic infelic- ities are minor and they should not detract from the overall high quality of this fine text book. 58 Book review I Lingua 111 (2001) 5342 With the publication of this volume, Georgetown University Press continues its impressive record of providing linguists with high quality texts in the area of His- panic linguistics. This book is a significant, and much needed state-of-the-art theo- retical contribution to Spanish phonology. Those who teach a course on this topic will find it to be indispensable.
